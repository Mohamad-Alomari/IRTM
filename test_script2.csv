40,oh how about we compromise and go on the small world ride at disneyland,Leonard
41,sure i’m still figuring out the thermoacoustic expander,Leonard
42,we only have two months to deliver this to the air force because of you,Leonard
43,guys we’re not gonna get anything done if we start fighting now can you please try,Leonard
44,it’s been three and a half minutes wake up,Leonard

63,your problem,Leonard
64,is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem,Leonard
65,sheldon we are dealing with an impossible deadline from the air force because of you so have an energy drink don’t have an energy drink order suppositories and shove ’em wherever you want i don’t care,Leonard
66,right listen to me we can’t do anything until you do your part so get up in front of this whiteboard and do it,Leonard
67,yes you can,Leonard
68,seriously,Leonard
69,it’s okay we’ll figure something out,Leonard
70,it’ll be fine you’ll see sheldon buddy sheldon snores,Leonard

72,right sorry sir,Leonard
73,sir,Leonard

81,there goes our big payday,Leonard
82,you do that too,Leonard
83,are you crazy you can’t put that on snapchat,Leonard
84,that’s not a bad idea,Leonard

96,where did you go to school,Leonard
97,i don’t know how i feel about this,Leonard

108,i didn’t even have to take my glasses off,Leonard
109,you can do this,Leonard
110,this is an euler’s disk it’s a physics toy that demonstrates angular momentum potential energy and kinetic energy,Leonard
111,but raj is from india which means he’s no slouch at holding his breath,Leonard
112,how ya doing,Leonard
113,dig deep like when we bet you couldn’t fit into howard’s pants,Leonard

135,and you think we can get those guys to reprogram sheldon cool,Leonard
136,that a bunch of awkward scientists with no social skills would invent a machine to do it for them,Leonard
137,i was thinking maybe a library or a gaming room,Leonard
138,i don’t like trains you like trains,Leonard
139,well when you get the machine you can find out,Leonard

142,oh yeah okay sure what’s going on with your brother,Leonard
143,huh is that a good idea i mean you think they’ll consider someone who was in prison for selling drugs,Leonard
144,well i’m sure he’ll appreciate carrying his samples in a briefcase instead of his colon how long do you think he’ll stay,Leonard
145,hmm who knows that’s exciting i’ll get to wake up every morning and see if he’s still here,Leonard
146,of course not i mean he’s your brother,Leonard

155,i’m not saying you have to ask my permission but you could have talked to me about it before you said it was okay,Leonard
156,our gaming room i was gonna put a scented candle in it,Leonard
157,because i didn’t want to sound like a jerk,Leonard
158,if you get him a job he’s gonna live here forever,Leonard

174,fine go for a little walk,Leonard
175,just keep walking,Leonard
176,at least it’s quiet when he takes bathroom breaks,Leonard
177,you’re kidding,Leonard
178,you know i do have a way to get him out of our hair i’ve been holding onto this for a few years but maybe now’s the time,Leonard
179,you can’t kill him he’ll just respawn at the last save point,Leonard
180,hey uh buddy i got you a little present,Leonard
181,yeah go ahead open it,Leonard
182,okay where were we,Leonard
183,this train thing worked out better than i thought he’s home studying the engineer’s manual,Leonard
184,four thousand dollars worth every penny,Leonard
185,colonel williams sir,Leonard
186,as a cooling solution it’s pretty cool,Leonard
187,oh nothing just some math we don’t need,Leonard
188,it’s just a theory uh it’s not even worked out,Leonard
189,sir uh if i may uh we’ve put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype it’s a really elegant solution and most importantly it works,Leonard
190,oh boohoo i spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon what is that,Leonard
191,okay look sheldon the colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller and we can’t do it without you,Leonard
192,sheldon you can still go on the trip in a few weeks just help us out,Leonard
193,come on you know you’re not leaving physics why are you doing this,Leonard
194,okay this is everything he had on the board i’m sure we can figure the rest out,Leonard
195,oh we can get this is there any chance it’s upsidedown,Leonard
196,it’s classified if we tell anyone we’d get in trouble,Leonard
197,just keep thinking i got it,Leonard
198,no but when we show this nonsense to sheldon it will make him crazy and he’ll have to fix it,Leonard
199,yeah i know that’s not even a math symbol that’s just charlie brown’s hair,Leonard
200,well sheldon turns out we didn’t need you after all,Leonard
201,no,Leonard
202,aren’t you gonna look at the board to see how right we are,Leonard
203,just look at the board,Leonard
204,oh no what should we have done differently,Leonard
205,come on sheldon you can’t turn your back on physics and besides you have no idea what you’re doing with this stuff,Leonard
206,and instead of standing around watching you can help us build your smaller guidance system,Leonard
207,so what do you say,Leonard
208,what,Leonard
209,we’re not gonna be brothers we’re not gonna be stepbrothers go to sleep,Leonard
210,go to sleep,Leonard

249,yeah my record was six,Leonard
250,no don’t do that,Leonard
251,oh true but think of how much you’ve accomplished who got him to stop purelling his pocket change,Leonard

253,and who got him to try a turkey dog,Leonard
254,how can you stop now that’s like walking out of pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy,Leonard

292,i would like to keep the official flag of our apartment,Leonard
293,yeah i like this one,Leonard
294,but you made me order it because you were too wellknown in the flag community and they’d jack up the price,Leonard
295,oh i do the the field of blue represents you being miserable and the lion sticking its tongue out means i’m happy about it,Leonard

299,you’re good at revenge how do we get him back,Leonard
300,sheldon i know what you did now change the password back,Leonard
301,sheldon i’m warning you i can play this game too,Leonard
302,all right i tried,Leonard
303,hey,Leonard
304,separating my delicates,Leonard
305,no this is the level i am stooping to i believe that is flag to crotch four checkmate easypeasy ooh so breezy,Leonard

324,that stinks how long are you out of the apartment,Leonard
325,buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water can’t have your head shoved in a toilet as much as i did and not pick up a few things about plumbing,Leonard
326,and we live with sheldon so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning,Leonard
327,mmhmm for two of us it’s in the right direction,Leonard
328,it’s only for five weeks,Leonard
329,you just shaved yesterday you’re good for three months,Leonard
330,okay star trek the original series the enterprise was on a fiveyear mission to explore new worlds think of this as your personal fiveweek mission to do the same,Leonard
331,that’s a good question maybe just don’t come over,Leonard
332,just nod and smile he’s almost gone,Leonard
333,i’m trying to think of an answer that won’t stop you from doing this,Leonard
334,never leave a belt on the floor at night they look like snakes,Leonard
335,keep mm’s in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line,Leonard
336,he startles easily so please no flash photography,Leonard

368,well we had started bingewatching luke cage together and it was kind of our thing and then i find out that she watched two episodes without me,Leonard
369,oh yeah and you thought spock ears were only good for comiccon,Leonard
370,oh cool i’ll be like a pointyeared paul bunyan,Leonard
371,stupid idea,Leonard

798,guys we’re not gonna get anything done if we start fighting now can you please try,Leonard
799,it’s been three and a half minutes wake up,Leonard
800,oh i had a good dream that when i carried you to bed i let your head hit the wall and i laughed,Leonard
801,what is this,Leonard
802,oh that is so nice,Leonard
803,so what are you guys gonna do today,Leonard
804,you don’t think you’ll be bored,Leonard
805,oh it’s complicated he finds pushing that little door and reaching up into the machine,Leonard
806,are you okay,Leonard
807,according to the world’s worst cuckoo clock it’s two,Leonard
808,what,Leonard
809,so,Leonard
810,you only had one,Leonard
811,we can’t afford to lose any more time,Leonard
812,that’s not helpful it’s fun to think about but it’s not helpful hey sheldon we are on a serious time crunch we can’t do this without you can you please pull it together,Leonard
813,thank you,Leonard
814,i’m gonna get some coffee you want some,Leonard
815,uh okay let’s pretend you do have a problem,Leonard
816,you don’t,Leonard
817,no you don’t but let’s say you do and don’t say you do because you don’t now wouldn’t you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it,Leonard
818,your problem,Leonard
819,is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem,Leonard
820,sheldon we are dealing with an impossible deadline from the air force because of you so have an energy drink don’t have an energy drink order suppositories and shove ’em wherever you want i don’t care,Leonard
821,right listen to me we can’t do anything until you do your part so get up in front of this whiteboard and do it,Leonard
822,yes you can,Leonard
823,seriously,Leonard
824,it’s okay we’ll figure something out,Leonard
825,it’ll be fine you’ll see sheldon buddy sheldon snores,Leonard
826,um i don’t really know how to say this,Leonard
827,right sorry sir,Leonard
828,sir,Leonard
829,i understand that we’re under contract and i don’t know what the consequences of violating that are but uh we’re not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised,Leonard
830,thanks for understanding sir,Leonard
831,all right pressure’s off,Leonard
832,so some alien kid spent his money on the asthmaandglasses upgrade for me,Leonard
833,what’s up,Leonard
834,really,Leonard
835,you realize if the military declares our research classified they can take the whole thing away from us,Leonard
836,there goes our big payday,Leonard
837,you do that too,Leonard
838,are you crazy you can’t put that on snapchat,Leonard
839,that’s not a bad idea,Leonard
840,you’re not a lawyer sheldon you’re just a knowitall,Leonard
841,that’s the definition of being a knowitall,Leonard
842,hi,Leonard
843,i saw it it’s big,Leonard
844,someday when i’m up on murder charges you’ll be hearing from me,Leonard
845,‘cause when you talk it enrages people,Leonard
846,yes,Leonard
847,i’m getting enraged,Leonard
848,don’t speak,Leonard
849,hi,Leonard
850,exactly yeah you have a good grasp of the physics,Leonard
851,where did you go to school,Leonard
852,i don’t know how i feel about this,Leonard
853,that’s a lot less big,Leonard
854,which means i won’t be able to make penny breakfast every day and she’ll realize my brioche french toast was the only thing keeping her in the marriage,Leonard
855,oh thanks man,Leonard
856,well the colonel said it was for the good of the country and the funding is substantial,Leonard

862,oh my turn my turn,Leonard
863,i didn’t even have to take my glasses off,Leonard
864,you can do this,Leonard
865,this is an euler’s disk it’s a physics toy that demonstrates angular momentum potential energy and kinetic energy,Leonard
866,but raj is from india which means he’s no slouch at holding his breath,Leonard
867,how ya doing,Leonard
868,dig deep like when we bet you couldn’t fit into howard’s pants,Leonard

871,who forgot to crack the window,Leonard
872,hey,Leonard
873,what’s going on with your dad,Leonard
874,but all you did was complain when he did that,Leonard
875,i’m sorry is he waiting for someone to disagree,Leonard
876,i’m trying but i’m judging,Leonard
877,yeah well we work at the same place as you and we’ve always been fine,Leonard

881,what if he lives in your garage,Leonard
882,yeah,Leonard
883,oh you brought your own lunch good for you,Leonard

888,you’re not being very nice,Leonard
889,careful i saw this on star trek smoke’s gonna come out of his ears soon hey,Leonard
890,and you think we can get those guys to reprogram sheldon cool,Leonard
891,that a bunch of awkward scientists with no social skills would invent a machine to do it for them,Leonard
892,i was thinking maybe a library or a gaming room,Leonard
893,i don’t like trains you like trains,Leonard
894,well when you get the machine you can find out,Leonard
895,no raj that’s a terrible idea,Leonard
896,hey great news the tv i want will fit in the gaming room and if i leave the curtains open i can watch it from work,Leonard
897,oh yeah okay sure what’s going on with your brother,Leonard
898,huh is that a good idea i mean you think they’ll consider someone who was in prison for selling drugs,Leonard
899,well i’m sure he’ll appreciate carrying his samples in a briefcase instead of his colon how long do you think he’ll stay,Leonard
900,hmm who knows that’s exciting i’ll get to wake up every morning and see if he’s still here,Leonard
901,of course not i mean he’s your brother,Leonard
902,remember that when the new tv falls off the wall and crushes us both,Leonard
903,yeah sure he really worked with the drug enforcement agency,Leonard
904,how’s it working out,Leonard
905,that’s great i’m happy for you,Leonard
906,no it doesn’t,Leonard
907,no,Leonard
908,i said no,Leonard
909,fine you invited your drug dealer brother to stay with us for god knows how long and didn’t bother to ask me first,Leonard
910,i’m not saying you have to ask my permission but you could have talked to me about it before you said it was okay,Leonard
911,our gaming room i was gonna put a scented candle in it,Leonard
912,because i didn’t want to sound like a jerk,Leonard
913,if you get him a job he’s gonna live here forever,Leonard
914,has he ever had his own place,Leonard
915,did it have a metal toilet next to the bed,Leonard
916,stay out of this you and your stupid machine started this fight,Leonard
917,we owe you an apology,Leonard
918,that was six years ago i’m talking about tonight,Leonard
919,and sorry about the suitcase,Leonard
920,mm penny’s gonna call her dad and tell him it’s not a good time for randall to visit,Leonard

923,that’s because we are,Leonard
924,we can’t he was already fixed when i found him at the shelter,Leonard
925,nicely done howard,Leonard
926,good for you on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child,Leonard
927,that’s great but the air force approved the specs we’re good to go,Leonard
928,can we please stop talking about poodles,Leonard
929,fine go for a little walk,Leonard
930,just keep walking,Leonard
931,at least it’s quiet when he takes bathroom breaks,Leonard
932,you’re kidding,Leonard
933,you know i do have a way to get him out of our hair i’ve been holding onto this for a few years but maybe now’s the time,Leonard
934,you can’t kill him he’ll just respawn at the last save point,Leonard
935,hey uh buddy i got you a little present,Leonard
936,yeah go ahead open it,Leonard
937,okay where were we,Leonard
938,this train thing worked out better than i thought he’s home studying the engineer’s manual,Leonard
939,four thousand dollars worth every penny,Leonard
940,colonel williams sir,Leonard
941,as a cooling solution it’s pretty cool,Leonard
942,oh nothing just some math we don’t need,Leonard
943,it’s just a theory uh it’s not even worked out,Leonard
944,sir uh if i may uh we’ve put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype it’s a really elegant solution and most importantly it works,Leonard
945,oh boohoo i spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon what is that,Leonard
946,okay look sheldon the colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller and we can’t do it without you,Leonard
947,sheldon you can still go on the trip in a few weeks just help us out,Leonard
948,come on you know you’re not leaving physics why are you doing this,Leonard
949,okay this is everything he had on the board i’m sure we can figure the rest out,Leonard
950,oh we can get this is there any chance it’s upsidedown,Leonard
951,it’s classified if we tell anyone we’d get in trouble,Leonard
952,just keep thinking i got it,Leonard
953,no but when we show this nonsense to sheldon it will make him crazy and he’ll have to fix it,Leonard
954,yeah i know that’s not even a math symbol that’s just charlie brown’s hair,Leonard
955,well sheldon turns out we didn’t need you after all,Leonard
956,no,Leonard
957,aren’t you gonna look at the board to see how right we are,Leonard
958,just look at the board,Leonard
959,oh no what should we have done differently,Leonard
960,come on sheldon you can’t turn your back on physics and besides you have no idea what you’re doing with this stuff,Leonard
961,and instead of standing around watching you can help us build your smaller guidance system,Leonard
962,so what do you say,Leonard
963,what,Leonard
964,we’re not gonna be brothers we’re not gonna be stepbrothers go to sleep,Leonard
965,go to sleep,Leonard

983,oh you too hey everyone this is my mother beverley,Leonard
984,and he can’t wait to meet you too can i get anyone a drink,Leonard
985,penny as a scientist my job is to figure out why things happen but i don’t think i’ll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you you know maybe i don’t,Leonard
986,thank you,Leonard
987,hey i’m just thrilled we’re all getting along for a minute,Leonard

995,when you live with someone there’s gonna be conflict you just have to keep communicating,Leonard
996,hey you can make jokes but if this keeps up he’s gonna move back in here,Leonard
997,good then before we reintroduce them we’ll give him one of her sweaters so he can get used to her scent again,Leonard
998,no that’s actually what we did with him when howard came back from space,Leonard
999,look here’s the thing you need to understand about sheldon he’s the worst,Leonard
1000,i prefer to think of myself as fiveten but i still need to get all my pants hemmed,Leonard
1001,don’t beat yourself up you’ve never lived with anyone before,Leonard
1002,and you’re starting out with sheldon cooper that’s like getting your first pet and having it be i don’t know what’s a kind of pet that ruins your life,Leonard
1003,look even when penny and i started living together there was a learning curve but i promise you it does get easier,Leonard
1004,yeah my record was six,Leonard
1005,no don’t do that,Leonard
1006,oh true but think of how much you’ve accomplished who got him to stop purelling his pocket change,Leonard
1007,and who got him to put things other than gloves in the glove compartment,Leonard
1008,and who got him to try a turkey dog,Leonard
1009,how can you stop now that’s like walking out of pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy,Leonard
1010,of course you do,Leonard
1011,oh he can try he’d just need a good locksmith,Leonard

1029,it’s not just howard and bernadette i mean look how far we’ve all come,Leonard
1030,penny was a struggling actress when we met and now she’s a successful pharmaceutical rep,Leonard
1031,sheldon howard and i are working with the government on our quantum gyroscope,Leonard
1032,sorry stuart,Leonard
1033,i’ve come to peace with my relationship with my parents that was a big milestone for me,Leonard
1034,oh like halley’s comet,Leonard
1035,hey guys what are you oh that’s here cool,Leonard
1036,yes you do,Leonard

1044,well now they’re yours,Leonard
1045,well you know what’s gonna happen he’s just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his,Leonard
1046,you know what there is one thing i would like,Leonard
1047,i would like to keep the official flag of our apartment,Leonard
1048,yeah i like this one,Leonard
1049,but you made me order it because you were too wellknown in the flag community and they’d jack up the price,Leonard
1050,oh i do the the field of blue represents you being miserable and the lion sticking its tongue out means i’m happy about it,Leonard
1051,is the wifi working for you,Leonard
1052,oh i knew it sheldon changed the password,Leonard
1053,well the new network name is ha ha ha now i’ve got you so it’s either sheldon or gargamel from the smurfs,Leonard
1054,you’re good at revenge how do we get him back,Leonard
1055,sheldon i know what you did now change the password back,Leonard
1056,sheldon i’m warning you i can play this game too,Leonard
1057,all right i tried,Leonard
1058,hey,Leonard
1059,separating my delicates,Leonard
1060,no this is the level i am stooping to i believe that is flag to crotch four checkmate easypeasy ooh so breezy,Leonard
1061,no last time that old lady in the park kept screaming watch out he’s right behind you hello,Leonard
1062,uh can i help you,Leonard
1063,unbelievable okay uh i don’t know what he told you but you can’t stay here,Leonard
1064,sheldon what do you think you’re doing,Leonard
1065,and just leave him here alone,Leonard
1066,uh theodore how long are you planning to stay exactly,Leonard
1067,this is ridiculous,Leonard
1068,sheldon get out here,Leonard
1069,we lived together years how can you be so awful to me,Leonard
1070,because you were being selfish,Leonard
1071,why i said i didn’t care,Leonard
1072,yeah thanks but nobody asked you,Leonard
1073,well for me too it’s not the same with you gone,Leonard
1074,no,Leonard

1076,you promise,Leonard
1077,good,Leonard
1078,well i’m sure at some point we won’t even notice it’s there,Leonard
1079,that stinks how long are you out of the apartment,Leonard
1080,buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water can’t have your head shoved in a toilet as much as i did and not pick up a few things about plumbing,Leonard
1081,and we live with sheldon so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning,Leonard
1082,mmhmm for two of us it’s in the right direction,Leonard
1083,it’s only for five weeks,Leonard
1084,you just shaved yesterday you’re good for three months,Leonard
1085,okay star trek the original series the enterprise was on a fiveyear mission to explore new worlds think of this as your personal fiveweek mission to do the same,Leonard
1086,that’s a good question maybe just don’t come over,Leonard
1087,just nod and smile he’s almost gone,Leonard
1088,i’m trying to think of an answer that won’t stop you from doing this,Leonard
1089,never leave a belt on the floor at night they look like snakes,Leonard
1090,keep mm’s in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line,Leonard
1091,he startles easily so please no flash photography,Leonard
1092,you enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before,Leonard
1093,you guys have fun,Leonard

1099,i know exactly what we are gonna do,Leonard
1100,hey sheldon’s not here so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear,Leonard
1101,oh don’t worry once you see my sweet moves sex is inevitable,Leonard
1102,i’ll just let my hips do the talkin’,Leonard
1103,the world may have forgotten about dance dance revolution but not this smooth criminal,Leonard
1104,you were right,Leonard
1105,i feel like i pulled something why didn’t you tell me to stop,Leonard
1106,if you ever need a break the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee,Leonard
1107,yeah,Leonard
1108,eh,Leonard
1109,do it,Leonard
1110,yeah let me finish packing this stuff up you know how sheldon is if he sees christmas stuff lying around after new year’s,Leonard
1111,well he doesn’t live at walmart but he still threw a tantrum when he saw marshmallow peeps after easter and that’s the same man who complains you can’t find marshmallow peeps after easter,Leonard
1112,well he didn’t throw up on the baby that’s a win,Leonard
1113,did you at least have a good flight down there,Leonard
1114,and before our next drive to comiccon i need the name of that juice,Leonard
1115,hold on how did you get him in the car,Leonard
1116,who knows what he has down there,Leonard
1117,absolutely not,Leonard
1118,absolutely not,Leonard
1119,hey,Leonard
1120,and their sherpas,Leonard
1121,on purpose not the way it used to happen in high school,Leonard
1122,it might’ve been the worst one we’ve ever had,Leonard
1123,well we had started bingewatching luke cage together and it was kind of our thing and then i find out that she watched two episodes without me,Leonard
1124,oh yeah and you thought spock ears were only good for comiccon,Leonard
1125,oh cool i’ll be like a pointyeared paul bunyan,Leonard
1126,stupid idea,Leonard
1127,for the tenth time my mittens were slippery,Leonard
1128,you know how easily i blister,Leonard
1129,look we could keep fighting and let it ruin our night or or we can stop and try to salvage the evening,Leonard
1130,thank you,Leonard
1131,yeah,Leonard
1132,do not need a break,Leonard
1133,if i need a break i’ll ask for a break,Leonard

1137,by the way if anyone asks the elevator shaft always had a tree in it,Leonard
1138,ignore him how did you get the baby to stop crying,Leonard
1139,please tell me you didn’t use amy’s magic juice,Leonard
1140,see you guys at work,Leonard
1141,‭yeah it’s a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad dlist celebrities to appear why‬,Leonard
1142,that’s awesome is this for serial apeist,Leonard
1143,when is it,Leonard
1144,what why not,Leonard
1145,yeah but it’s not pathetic that’s where i draw the line come on we’ll have fun,Leonard
1146,you’ll have nerds fawning all over you if you don’t love that this marriage is in trouble,Leonard
1147,yeah wow an appearance by george lucas… ‘s dermatologist oh i want that autograph,Leonard
1148,oh everything we need for your autograph session head shots markers,Leonard
1149,are you kidding i once paid twenty dollars for theo sassler’s signature,Leonard
1150,oh i don’t even know i just liked his name theo sassler okay and look at this i even got a change maker how much change you want little lady,Leonard
1151,yeah well if it’s a dollar you’re in luck,Leonard
1152,never been on this side of the table before i feel powerful,Leonard
1153,okay so it’s four seventyfive for a signed blackandwhite and nine ninetyfive for a colour,Leonard
1154,well i brought my moneymaker let me shake it,Leonard
1155,oh you think he’s your first autograph,Leonard
1156,would you like an autograph,Leonard
1157,that’ll be four seventyfive,Leonard
1158,but iii oh nothing about that was good,Leonard
1159,okay let’s keep it moving,Leonard
1160,should’ve punched that guy,Leonard
1161,why do you do that can’t you let me have my moment,Leonard
1162,no she cannot kiss what is wrong with you people,Leonard
1163,no no no it’s not okay,Leonard
1164,i’m her husband,Leonard
1165,i am,Leonard
1166,well she moved in across the hall,Leonard
1167,like a river carves a canyon,Leonard
1168,that’s right i’m her change daddy,Leonard
1169,and that is how a short asthmatic scientist landed a stone cold fox,Leonard
1170,the third time i did it in skywriting but she never looked up,Leonard
1171,yeah i said no,Leonard
1172,i just wanted to make her work for it,Leonard
1173,she makes more money than i do,Leonard
1174,it’s cute they’re having fun living together,Leonard
1175,what do you mean,Leonard
1176,so she’s just been lying to him,Leonard
1177,yeah but to make him leave not to make him stay,Leonard
1178,so their plan for saving the earth from armageddon is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball,Leonard
1179,you’re awful quiet everything okay,Leonard
1180,i wouldn’t worry about it she’s probably just distracted by work,Leonard
1181,buddy buddy listen nothing bad is going on she just she just didn’t want you to know that the work on her apartment was finished a couple weeks ago,Leonard
1182,she’s enjoying living with you and she didn’t want it to end early,Leonard

1518,you’re talking about me very funny although i would enjoy drawing up a budget and forcing raj to adhere to it without an ounce of compassion,Sheldon
1519,very well hey comiccon tickets go on sale this friday you can’t buy one,Sheldon
1520,she’s gonna hate waiting in line for the panels,Sheldon

1527,if i may speak for comiccon we don’t want that either,Sheldon
1528,no but it’s honest and it sounds like you could use a little more honesty in your relationship,Sheldon
1529,i’m always honest with amy the other day she said she was selfconscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder and i said you know you can call that a beauty mark all you want when there’s hair growing out of it that’s a mole,Sheldon
1530,i should hope so when she called me an insensitive jerk i’d like to think she meant it,Sheldon
1531,very well prepare for a long night of deceit,Sheldon
1532,i was talking about leonard and if make up is so truthful why is it called concealer,Sheldon
1533,he doesn’t really want penny to go to comiccon he’s just doing it to make her happy,Sheldon
1534,so they’re both trying to make each other happy and the end result is they make each other sad that’s hilarious i can’t wait to tell them,Sheldon

1536,well if you haven’t noticed i’ve been between them for the last ten years,Sheldon
1537,hello,Sheldon

1602,gentlemen i think we are losing sight of the real issue we are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs in the militaryindustrial complex isn’t that exciting,Sheldon
1603,not at all in star wars when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation harassing civilians didn’t you ever think hey that could be me,Sheldon

1608,i don’t see how a tax lawyer from fort lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property,Sheldon
1609,hello,Sheldon
1610,don’t sign anything that’s your advice okay so uh if during this meeting one of us were to say complete an oil painting you’d recommend that we leave that unsigned,Sheldon
1611,that’s what you said,Sheldon
1612,this must be how you practice law in boca raton by saying things you don’t mean and meaning things you don’t say,Sheldon
1613,you don’t need him i’ll represent you,Sheldon
1614,i don’t understand why i can’t talk at this meeting,Sheldon
1615,okay quick question am i allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel,Sheldon

1617,fine ooh can i use texttospeech software,Sheldon
1618,strangled sound,Sheldon
1619,yeah we’ll do it in two hi i’m dr sheldon cooper i’m the actual brains behind this project also engineers aren’t real scientists mit’s a trade school and the death star is from star wars not star trek but otherwise thank you for your service,Sheldon
1620,hello,Sheldon
1621,oh leonard’s mad at me so i’m making him lemon bars,Sheldon
1622,not really but i’m mad at him too so lemon bars it is,Sheldon
1623,they made me promise i wouldn’t talk,Sheldon
1624,well now see you knew what was gonna happen why didn’t they anyway now we’re committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame and everyone’s upset with me,Sheldon
1625,mm if it makes you feel any better a parasitoid wasp known as oobius depressus has been rediscovered after years of presumed extinction,Sheldon
1626,why would your bernadette thing make me feel better at least mine was educational,Sheldon
1627,look i’m sorry tell me why bernadette is upset with you,Sheldon
1628,why would you do that,Sheldon
1629,see that’s exactly what happened to me except that i said it on purpose and i have no regrets,Sheldon
1630,i never realized this building was classified,Sheldon
1631,the way you put away those lemon bars perhaps that’s a good thing,Sheldon
1632,why it clearly doesn’t work,Sheldon
1633,impressive,Sheldon
1634,there’s no way,Sheldon
1635,its weight and smoothness along with the slight concavity of the mirror means it can spin for a long time,Sheldon
1636,kind of busy right now,Sheldon
1637,he’s not gonna make it,Sheldon
1638,you know deepsea divers holding their breath for several minutes have shown elevated markers of a protein that can signal brain damage,Sheldon
1639,it’s slowing down,Sheldon
1640,he’s not gonna make it,Sheldon
1641,oh i won’t i only eat equilateral triangles isosceles isosceles oh scalene you didn’t see that,Sheldon
1642,why,Sheldon
1643,i have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise,Sheldon
1644,if the judge couldn’t explain it to me i don’t see how you will,Sheldon
1645,hello,Sheldon
1646,well have a lovely evening,Sheldon
1647,if you think that’s more fun than talking to zachary quinto through a stall door you’re crazy,Sheldon
1648,msn search altavista and ask jeeves you,Sheldon
1649,bert i insist that you join us,Sheldon
1650,not at all amy,Sheldon
1651,well i could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad,Sheldon
1652,you want me to look at him and listen to him,Sheldon
1653,actually we met online,Sheldon
1654,although unlike your date she actually showed up oh he looks sad again,Sheldon
1655,no no i only told leonard howard raj kripke uh professor wu professor klein and a lunch lady in the cafeteria how everyone else found out is a mystery to me,Sheldon
1656,why aren’t you talking to me,Sheldon
1657,oh well now i’m sorry i asked,Sheldon
1658,what is there to gossip about we barely have one,Sheldon
1659,is it safe to assume you’re not speaking to me again if you’re not answering because you’re not speaking to me perhaps we could come up with a signal that works,Sheldon
1660,well wait this is our first fight as a couple who live together,Sheldon
1661,i’m not sure of the protocol television teaches us that the man’s supposed to sleep on the couch but of the two of us you’re clearly more sofasized,Sheldon
1662,this isn’t fair you’ve discussed aspects of our physical relationship with penny,Sheldon
1663,that lady has a name i don’t know what it is but one time i accidentally called her mom,Sheldon
1664,knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy,Sheldon
1665,not exactly the welcome wagon but i’ll take it,Sheldon
1666,i’m mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed i call these circles zones of privacy don’t google that unless you want to see pictures of people’s genitals this circle contains only me and you it represents subjects we only share with each other details of physical intimacy bathroom habits although as i’m saying it i may need to add dr fink in here,Sheldon
1667,no i was just excited to list him as a friend,Sheldon
1668,i’m sorry you were embarrassed and now i understand that some things are just between you and me and in the event of redness and swelling dr fink,Sheldon
1669,that’s reserved for thoughts i don’t share with anyone,Sheldon
1670,of course,Sheldon
1671,no they’re private,Sheldon
1672,a little,Sheldon
1673,fine two years ago i got my driver’s license,Sheldon
1674,i like being chauffeured around it makes me feel important,Sheldon
1675,no you didn’t but keep in mind i felt extremely important,Sheldon
1676,excuse me may i have your attention please i have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with amy farrah fowler has become water cooler gossip and i just want to say shame on all of you we’re scientists our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge not the intimate details of other people’s lives,Sheldon
1677,thank you bert you’re a good man that woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out,Sheldon
1678,oh oh i’m sorry correction that woman not only had vigorous coitus with bert she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done – that better,Sheldon
1679,all right well to sum up focus on science keep your nose out of other people’s business and uh whoa for a good time call bert,Sheldon
1680,well last night amy was angry with me because i’d been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters,Sheldon
1681,oh i know that now at first i thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps but it turns out no she was genuinely mortified,Sheldon
1682,that’s not a problem we can figure this out what are the reasons women reject raj,Sheldon
1683,doesn’t like games that’s one,Sheldon
1684,of course you’re fine not every member of a species finds a mate sir isaac newton died a virgin look at the contributions he made,Sheldon
1685,so now you think you’re better than isaac newton oh no wonder women don’t like you,Sheldon
1686,what he said he was fine,Sheldon
1687,oh that’s a paradox i mean if you meant what you just said then that means you may not have meant what you just said,Sheldon
1688,well i thought we were having a nice conversation but it turns out i was being offensive,Sheldon
1689,yeah,Sheldon
1690,we were discussing raj’s recent breakup and apparently i was insensitive to him,Sheldon
1691,don’t fall for it he’ll get you to compare him to a dead virgin and suddenly you’re the bad guy,Sheldon
1692,then why didn’t you say that,Sheldon
1693,well i would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind,Sheldon
1694,well it certainly would be easier you have no idea what it’s like to struggle with recognizing emotional cues,Sheldon
1695,thank you,Sheldon
1696,okay now you’re just showing off,Sheldon
1697,a machine that reads emotions is intriguing it could help me be a more considerate friend,Sheldon
1698,it could also help me identify my enemies discover their fears and then i could use those fears to destroy them,Sheldon
1699,you could make it a train room,Sheldon
1700,i know and amy says i can’t have a train room,Sheldon
1701,wonderful although i’m not sure how i feel about being used as a guinea pig,Sheldon
1702,yes now when the robots rise up they’ll know that i’ve been rooting for them the whole time,Sheldon
1703,you are happy,Sheldon
1704,aw somebody’s ignoring their tiny needle teeth but all right,Sheldon
1705,sad,Sheldon
1706,oh that makes sense ’cause she’s gone and you miss her,Sheldon
1707,and you’re worried that turkey neck is in your future what now see now it says you’re mad make up your mind,Sheldon
1708,hey leonard if you’re happy and you know it no need to clap your hands because i have an emotion detector,Sheldon
1709,surprisingly well,Sheldon
1710,no wait uh hold on oh what you are aren’t you sweet,Sheldon
1711,oh ooh and that makes leonard angry,Sheldon
1712,what leonard please i know an angry face when i see it it’s this red frowny guy on my phone,Sheldon
1713,yes,Sheldon
1714,it’s like you’re twins,Sheldon
1715,well hey now she’s angry too this thing works like gangbusters,Sheldon
1716,he’s still mad,Sheldon
1717,you first,Sheldon
1718,hey i shared my honey nut cheerios with you,Sheldon
1719,you are lucky that this feelings machine doesn’t have feelings,Sheldon
1720,gladly can we storm out,Sheldon
1721,fine i’ll just give them the finger,Sheldon
1722,not really,Sheldon
1723,i wish i never tried that device and i know i said the same thing after the massage chair but this time i mean it,Sheldon
1724,it’s more than that it’s me i always knew i had trouble recognizing other people’s emotions but that machine just made it so real,Sheldon
1725,i thought i was getting better at it but clearly i’m not,Sheldon
1726,yeah but that’s shooting fish in a barrel you’re kind of a sad sack i’m sorry i shouldn’t have said that i’m just upset,Sheldon
1727,i feel the same way about you now put your glasses back on you look weird,Sheldon
1728,yes,Sheldon
1729,oh it’s fine you needed a suitcase i wasn’t home you borrowed a suitcase,Sheldon
1730,oh well i thought we were going in order,Sheldon
1731,yeah well you should be your socks were still in it i had to throw it away anyway i uh trust that you’ve resolved your conflict,Sheldon
1732,uh guys it sounds like you’re getting angry again,Sheldon
1733,yes i don’t need an emotion machine i am one,Sheldon
1734,i did you know i’m not even sure how accurate it was i took it to the train store it said everyone was sad,Sheldon
1735,hey uh bernadette let’s test this theory what do you think i’m feeling right now,Sheldon
1736,keep filling this one with babies she’s good,Sheldon
1737,gentlemen we need to stop immediately,Sheldon
1738,i’m looking at the math and i think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller,Sheldon
1739,shame on you where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude i’ll tell you we would have the standard and the miniature poodle but no toy or teacup which by the way is not an officially recognized breed but that’s just poodle politics,Sheldon
1740,fine candy bars now do you enjoy a fun size i know you do,Sheldon
1741,i don’t want to go home,Sheldon
1742,then what,Sheldon
1743,oh that was my sixth trip to the bathroom as long as that’s not a urinary tract infection that’s a personal best,Sheldon
1744,really,Sheldon
1745,congratulations the bearer of this certificate is entitled to the ultimate train experience at the nevada northern railway you are at the throttle you are the engineer you are running the locomotive this doesn’t happen very often but here comes a hug oh dear i have to tinkle again,Sheldon
1746,you’ll never believe it leonard gave me the most incredible gift a trip to a historic railway and i get to operate an actual locomotive,Sheldon
1747,no idea all i know is i’m gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day,Sheldon
1748,oh no it’s not just me no the railway is four hours from the nearest airport and guess who gets to drive me,Sheldon
1749,you,Sheldon
1750,oh oh and guess where we get to sleep our choice of a turnofthecentury railway bunkhouse or a working caboose now the problem with a caboose is there’s no bathroom but the problem with the bunkhouse is it’s not a caboose on the first day i get to drive a steam engine oh and the second day a diesel engine oh and if i volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork they’ll let me stay as long as i want so you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives,Sheldon
1751,oh get this i get to take a test based on a page manual i get to learn things like hand signals ooh there’s forward uh reverse set the brakes are you done yet you’re missing,Sheldon
1752,oh hey if you knocked i couldn’t hear you i’m welding this locomotive engine and if you didn’t knock how about some manners,Sheldon
1753,i said to myself i think i can i think i can and then i couldn’t so i paid two men who promised not to come rob us later,Sheldon
1754,interesting well so i was right,Sheldon
1755,well i would love to help you but since i discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine i don’t think i can go back to theory i’m an engineer now and hey just to be clear a train engineer not that goofy kind you are,Sheldon
1756,sorry i need to work on this engine so when i get to the train yard i won’t look foolish,Sheldon
1757,leonard in the world of theoretical physics you never finish so much is unprovable but when i was studying that railway guide it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked then it clacked then it clicked then it clacked clickclack clicketyclack and here we are whoowhoo,Sheldon
1758,well good for you guys look i have a grease smudge on my hand and i’m okay with it,Sheldon
1759,no thanks i’m busy trying to fix this fuel pump,Sheldon
1760,oh well i guess it’s fixed,Sheldon
1761,that’s wrong,Sheldon
1762,well first of all you can’t use relativistic and nonrelativistic vectors in the same equation,Sheldon
1763,okay but this is the last time nice try blockheads,Sheldon
1764,excuse me i have a girlfriend i’m already king of the train store,Sheldon
1765,oh what choice do i have you need me i’m like the crankshaft of this team,Sheldon
1766,well whatever it is it looks heavy i’m gonna need you two to get it downstairs before amy comes home,Sheldon

1768,i’ve worked up a bit of a sweat,Sheldon
1769,may i borrow your water,Sheldon
1770,the light’s green,Sheldon
1771,gps says we’ll be at the railway in three hours,Sheldon
1772,leonard leonard,Sheldon
1773,you realize you and i could become brothers,Sheldon
1774,i hope you’re right ‘cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother’s wife is weird,Sheldon
1775,okay do you think your father’s doing unspeakable things to my mother,Sheldon
1776,are you saying that because the things are unspeakable,Sheldon
1777,very well,Sheldon
1778,hey if you want me to sleep you’re gonna have to stop talking,Sheldon
1779,it was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example,Sheldon
1780,whuh are we still doing the dumb thing okay why what’s wrong,Sheldon
1781,oh golly however did he humiliate you,Sheldon
1782,do i say stop what or just throw in the towel,Sheldon
1783,oh excuse me that is my mother you’re talking about however accurately,Sheldon
1784,and turned their phones off,Sheldon
1785,you know also if they did have coitus we’ll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist,Sheldon
1786,all right so less or equally awkward got it,Sheldon
1787,hello,Sheldon
1788,so did you defile my mother or not,Sheldon
1789,did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold,Sheldon
1790,or what a joy it is to behold my genitals,Sheldon
1791,a man named jesus convinced you to build a church in africa you’re kind of a sucker,Sheldon
1792,what in the chattahoochee national forest in georgia i can’t be the only one that knows that’s halfway,Sheldon
1793,what but he’s a mediocre academic and according to beverley his sexual prowess is subpar he’s basically leonard with a bigger prostate,Sheldon
1794,yes while also getting in a solid dig at you pretty efficient huh,Sheldon
1795,but why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents,Sheldon
1796,great now i have to start all over,Sheldon
1797,you made god sad today mom,Sheldon
1798,well that’s still no reason to rush into anything i mean look at us we took things remarkably slow you and i we didn’t even hold hands for two years,Sheldon
1799,hey hey she’s mine take a cold shower grandpa,Sheldon
1800,why do people cry at weddings,Sheldon
1801,speaking of love stds among the elderly are skyrocketing,Sheldon
1802,yeah excuse me i need to say something to someone pretty special and i just can’t wait any longer,Sheldon
1803,leonard you and i have our ups and downs but i have always considered you my family even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits i don’t always show it but you are of great importance to me both of you,Sheldon
1804,plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy,Sheldon
1805,yes ma’am,Sheldon
1806,well and you need to drive the car and mind your business,Sheldon
1807,what you’re not my mother,Sheldon
1808,yes ma’am,Sheldon
1809,will you two please inform amy how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule,Sheldon
1810,i can if you’d just roll over and accept your fate,Sheldon
1811,oh look who’s in favour of compromise the woman who married leonard hofstadter,Sheldon
1812,well i’m open to that,Sheldon
1813,i think we should see other people,Sheldon
1814,well as a male i have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my dna restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature,Sheldon
1815,don’t blame me blame your pal biology he’s the pervert pulling the strings here,Sheldon
1816,you know people are quick to accuse me of being difficult to live with but the truth is amy is just as challenging,Sheldon
1817,yes,Sheldon
1818,yes,Sheldon
1819,when we’re sleeping she breathes on me one night it got so bad i almost grabbed toto,Sheldon
1820,she’s always complaining about people at work,Sheldon
1821,do you know that when i get out of the shower she eyes me up and down like i’m a piece of meat,Sheldon
1822,i know sometimes i would just like to be appreciated for my mind,Sheldon
1823,have you noticed it’s always an aflat,Sheldon
1824,if we’re just going to drive around aimlessly the least you could do is take me for ice cream,Sheldon
1825,well see why can’t amy be that subservient she has coitus one time suddenly she’s gloria steinem anyway i suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women,Sheldon
1826,being with amy has awoken the sexual creature within when i see a pretty gal walking down the street i think hubba hubba like any other guy,Sheldon
1827,no no if we both like it i’ll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going aw no strawberry,Sheldon
1828,hmm well she spends her whole day scooping one arm’s probably bigger than the other,Sheldon
1829,you are truly wise,Sheldon
1830,i’d say wise beyond your years but you’re getting up there,Sheldon
1831,penny i am going to tell you a story that i’ve never told anyone,Sheldon
1832,i was years old and on spring break from college,Sheldon
1833,i came home early because they ran out of math to teach me,Sheldon
1834,my mother was at bible study i walked in the house expecting to find it empty and i heard a sound coming from my parents’ bedroom when i opened the door i saw my father having relations with another woman,Sheldon
1835,i know it’s also why i never open a door without knocking three times i mean the first,Sheldon
1836,we locked eyes i ran to my room and we never ever spoke of it,Sheldon
1837,since amy and i have been living together we’ve been bickering like my parents used to,Sheldon
1838,yes i need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road,Sheldon
1839,well anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone,Sheldon
1840,i’m sure you’re right i suppose i should apologize to you as well,Sheldon
1841,that must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you please understand that i think of you as more of a nanny,Sheldon
1842,hello,Sheldon
1843,i wanted to apologize for my behaviour today it it was unnecessary this is warm oh and also i am willing to forego the bathroom schedule,Sheldon
1844,amy you should know i was never really interested in seeing other women and to prove how serious i am about us i’m willing to take our relationship to the next level,Sheldon
1845,amy farrah fowler will you share this toothbrush holder with me,Sheldon
1846,amy wake up,Sheldon
1847,it’s midnight happy birthday,Sheldon
1848,this is for you i was going to wrap it but touching scotch tape gives me the heebiejeebies,Sheldon
1849,a functional mri of my brain i did sudoku before they took it so i’d be ripped,Sheldon
1850,and it’s not just an mri the orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because i was thinking of you,Sheldon
1851,we seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities,Sheldon
1852,i didn’t put on my comehither plaid pj’s for nothing,Sheldon
1853,yeah i’m afraid so childbirth looming coitus this is a banner night for female genitals,Sheldon
1854,wolowitz might hand out cigars i had to find my bubble gum cigar so i could join in without looking foolish,Sheldon
1855,i’m starting to rethink the flash onesie i bought this kid,Sheldon
1856,it doesn’t matter what i want it’s your birthday you decide,Sheldon
1857,that’s a bit childish isn’t it,Sheldon
1858,grape i find it the most mild,Sheldon
1859,well i believe we were kissing like randy teenagers and your nose was whistling ever so slightly,Sheldon
1860,oh don’t be you were like a foxy tea kettle,Sheldon
1861,very well,Sheldon
1862,i’m not sure earlier tonight things began organically and now it’s feeling forced like all the pirates of the caribbean sequels,Sheldon

1864,no and also i don’t want to disappoint you i you know come on it’s your birthday i can soldier through this,Sheldon
1865,intriguing is back on track a hint that it has something to do with trains,Sheldon
1866,because if it did have to do with trains and you were gonna give…,Sheldon
1867,not even a cozy sleeper car on the orient express,Sheldon
1868,who’s killing the mood now,Sheldon
1869,can i look yet,Sheldon

1873,you know i’ve been wanting to go,Sheldon
1874,oh you’re right i’m sorry,Sheldon
1875,five minutes we must be doing it wrong it took us hours,Sheldon
1876,she’s right you know i just learned amy went to a theme park without me but i’m not going to ruin her birthday i’ll wait and ruin individual hours sprinkled throughout the year boop,Sheldon
1877,but if my mom asks we have bunk beds,Sheldon
1878,i was not thinking it although now that you point it out it is undeniable,Sheldon
1879,raj show some compassion those are things that we think but don’t say,Sheldon
1880,oh speaking of personal growth i recently tried eating swiss chard you know i didn’t swallow it but amy said it counted,Sheldon
1881,some will be successful some may be homeless it’s fun to think about,Sheldon
1882,it was bernadette had her baby i made it to wizarding world and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration hankius pankius,Sheldon
1883,amy i just saw a magic train and reported somebody for cutting the line if that’s not foreplay i don’t know what is,Sheldon
1884,oh actually i would,Sheldon
1885,let’s take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here,Sheldon
1886,you know i have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building,Sheldon
1887,you know i wonder how she feels about all this artwork,Sheldon
1888,it truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with penny,Sheldon
1889,yeah it seems only right that she have it back,Sheldon
1890,look it’s the same smile she has in the painting,Sheldon
1891,yeah there’s hooks in the closet i can hang it right now,Sheldon
1892,what happened to them,Sheldon
1893,you know leonard the more i think about it there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and i should go through uh for example who gets our beloved sword longclaw,Sheldon
1894,that seems fair we did just give you the painting,Sheldon
1895,wonderful longclaw is mine and how about you keep our avocado plant,Sheldon
1896,although amy and i did just move in together and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift,Sheldon
1897,oh we got a sword and a plant our apartment’s really shaping up,Sheldon
1898,oh remember when we got this at comiccon,Sheldon
1899,it’s one of a kind,Sheldon
1900,well leonard you know who should keep this on the one hand i love mr spock more than you do on the other hand i care more about clocks than you do,Sheldon
1901,i’ll be right across the hall you’ll probably be able to hear it,Sheldon
1902,thank you,Sheldon
1903,oh now what about our d chess set,Sheldon
1904,well no i just didn’t think you’d want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win as a kindness i should probably take all the games,Sheldon
1905,are you sure these items represent our shared times together,Sheldon
1906,for a man so good at predicting my moves how come you stink at d chess,Sheldon
1907,it’s not my fault i’m bad at sharing i skipped kindergarten,Sheldon
1908,yeah take whatever you want,Sheldon
1909,but you don’t even like flags,Sheldon
1910,but i designed it,Sheldon
1911,but you don’t even understand its symbolism,Sheldon
1912,come along amy i know when i’m not wanted,Sheldon
1913,well powder me in sugar and call me a doughnut if it isn’t leonard hofstadter,Sheldon
1914,if it’s like your d chess game then you’re out of your length width and depth amy get the neosporin somebody just got burned,Sheldon
1915,all right i tried that should be the title of your autobiography ooh a seconddegree burn,Sheldon
1916,it’s a good thing you’re cute,Sheldon
1917,what do you think you’re doing,Sheldon
1918,this is the level you’re stooping to,Sheldon
1919,so there are fresh linens on the bed and oh well now i see you’ve met theodore theodore these are your new room mates leonard and penny they’re very honest but i would not leave cash lying around,Sheldon
1920,my room is paid up until the end of the month so i can do with it whatever i please which includes renting it out for a dollar a night,Sheldon
1921,anyway i’ll leave you be i have to oh oh he’s expecting a newspaper in the morning apparently they still make them,Sheldon
1922,that’s true but had i done something under the line there wouldn’t be a man in your kitchen who can’t produce a single form of id,Sheldon
1923,and now you know as much about him as i do,Sheldon
1924,will you keep it down what kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think i’m running,Sheldon
1925,i’m being awful you’re the one who went out of your way to hurt me,Sheldon
1926,dividing our belongings is difficult,Sheldon
1927,i have to admit leaving you to move in with amy has been harder than i thought it would be,Sheldon
1928,leonard i would like us to stop fighting about our possessions,Sheldon
1929,in fact i want you to keep the apartment flag and i’m not just saying that because it touched your genitals,Sheldon
1930,i do and to show you that there are no hard feelings i am willing to rub my genitals on it as well,Sheldon
1931,why are you all smiling like crazy people,Sheldon
1932,cohabitation with my girlfriend that’s a great deal to process,Sheldon
1933,i don’t know what if living together kills the romance,Sheldon
1934,yeah but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain i mean she’s never even seen me unshaven,Sheldon
1935,don’t try luring me in with sexy talk,Sheldon
1936,if you want to lure me in with sexy talk that’s how you do it,Sheldon
1937,not yet how will i learn if i’m comfortable living with amy or just comfortable because i’m in my own apartment now if this experiment is going to be valid i suggest a neutral environment,Sheldon
1938,well ideally an enclosed selfsustaining biodome in new mexico where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste,Sheldon
1939,interesting if my official residence were across the hall i wonder if i’d need to knock every time i came over here,Sheldon
1940,historically i don’t do well with change,Sheldon
1941,you’re darn right you wouldn’t no matter where i am this will always be my spot like an embassy in a foreign country this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom,Sheldon
1942,very well i’m on board,Sheldon
1943,yes i accept this fiveweek mission to share a living space with my girlfriend,Sheldon
1944,well now don’t be surprised if like star trek it’s cancelled in three,Sheldon
1945,oh thank you,Sheldon
1946,of course the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical sheldons and amys one pair that was neither dating nor living together one pair that was dating but not living together one pair that was living together but not dating and then of course one pair that was living together and dating although with that many sheldons it’d be such a party we’d never get anything done,Sheldon
1947,well you’ve lived with your significant other for some time i would like this experiment to go well are there any insights you can share,Sheldon
1948,you know leonard and i were very happy before you came along,Sheldon
1949,how many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move,Sheldon
1950,you truly are the goofus to my gallant,Sheldon
1951,oh excited concerned a little scared all the same emotions i feel in line at space mountain,Sheldon
1952,okay talk,Sheldon
1953,wow no foreplay or anything just right to it,Sheldon
1954,you’re really okay with that,Sheldon
1955,this is such a relief honestly if it didn’t get you all worked up i’d kiss you right now,Sheldon
1956,i know they probably shouldn’t sell those to children,Sheldon
1957,enjoy having the place to yourselves,Sheldon
1958,it’s penny’s bedroom plenty of men have gone before,Sheldon
1959,i guess this is it,Sheldon
1960,you too oh don’t forget tuesday the air filters need to be changed,Sheldon
1961,oh oh and every other day check the water level on the avocado pit,Sheldon
1962,leonard please let me go,Sheldon
1963,oh bye,Sheldon
1964,i guess the experiment begins,Sheldon
1965,which side of the bed would you prefer,Sheldon
1966,no no we’re living together now everything’s equal you know i know that i have a tendency to be controlling so i would rather you choose,Sheldon
1967,well clearly it’s not whatever i want because what i want is for you to make this decision and you refuse to do that,Sheldon
1968,like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom and then watched me roll right into traffic,Sheldon
1969,fine okay now on this side i am closer to the exit in case of emergency,Sheldon
1970,no but i’m also closer to the entrance in case of attack,Sheldon
1971,ah then again what are the odds of someone attacking me,Sheldon
1972,now this side offers me proximity to the bathroom but i am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep,Sheldon
1973,i suppose that works,Sheldon
1974,although now i’m kind of worried someone’s hiding behind those drapes,Sheldon
1975,be grateful i’m still in the room,Sheldon
1976,oh i’m just happy i don’t know what this memory foam remembers,Sheldon
1977,well it’s funny you should ask because i was wondering how you’d feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall,Sheldon
1978,okay well i am sorry i’m just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night and no offence but your bottom radiates enough heat i’m surprised there aren’t iguanas lying on it,Sheldon
1979,no dr feynman if i solve it for you you’ll never learn,Sheldon
1980,what are you doing down there,Sheldon
1981,who are you calling aaargh,Sheldon
1982,good morning see i didn’t knock but it’s fine i didn’t knock but it’s fine i didn’t knock but it’s fine so how is everyone,Sheldon
1983,really i slept great,Sheldon
1984,how you had the whole floor to yourself,Sheldon
1985,well but what kind of scientists would we be drawing a conclusion after only hours of data,Sheldon
1986,wow i anticipated we’d have problems but i never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them,Sheldon
1987,if the lab room disposable shoe cover fits,Sheldon
1988,how dare you,Sheldon
1989,whoa whoa now you’re making fun of my bona fides,Sheldon
1990,well if you are so protective of the scientific method perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started,Sheldon
1991,for science maybe you should,Sheldon
1992,fine,Sheldon
1993,great,Sheldon
1994,does stephen hawking roll through the quad,Sheldon
1995,hello,Sheldon
1996,oh you know the lone star state hmm that should be its yelp rating,Sheldon
1997,yeah it is good to be home oh good lord is that mistletoe don’t you maniacs own a calendar,Sheldon
1998,it was fine other than the weirdtasting juice amy gave me i slept the whole way,Sheldon
1999,well we were on our way to my mother’s house…,Sheldon
2000,how did we get in the car,Sheldon
2001,do we have to i really don’t want to hear the religious lecture,Sheldon
2002,there’s always one she gave it to my sister about her boyfriend my brother about his girlfriend my father about his girlfriend that one had some unchristian words in it,Sheldon
2003,eh i don’t know i am her precious little boy and you did take my flower,Sheldon
2004,anyway…,Sheldon
2005,given that your hands prepared it isn’t that a little selfserving,Sheldon
2006,welcome to texas,Sheldon
2007,oh wait wait shouldn’t we just eat you know i mean god did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these sloppy joes,Sheldon
2008,all right this is on you amy and i are living together in sin like a couple of new yorkers now while you scold us i’m going to get a knife and a fork joe may be sloppy but sheldon’s not,Sheldon
2009,what wh where’s the judgment wh where’s the fire and brimstone where’s the part where you tell us we’re going to hell and i say have you seen the size of the bugs outside we’re already there,Sheldon
2010,and what special circumstances are those,Sheldon
2011,what so you thought i was going to be alone for the rest of my life,Sheldon
2012,well this is highly insulting,Sheldon
2013,i’m the child she was worried about i have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldn’t power a potato clock if i spotted them the potato,Sheldon
2014,well i was in my room i couldn’t hear what they were saying,Sheldon
2015,just being the unsocialised eccentric my mother always thought i was,Sheldon
2016,yeah and i don’t understand why you’re taking her side by being my girlfriend she’s saying you’re a weirdo too,Sheldon
2017,and,Sheldon
2018,can you believe my mother thinks we’re both strange,Sheldon
2019,well first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off and then we went out,Sheldon
2020,you’re right i have leonard and howard and raj stuart penny leonard’s mom bernadette wil wheaton…,Sheldon
2021,i was going chronologically you’re right between koothrappali’s father and omar the oneeyed sparkletts guy,Sheldon
2022,i knew we should’ve never mentioned us living together in the first place,Sheldon
2023,disagree we’ve known about evolution since she still believes in noah and his amazing zoo boat this could have all been avoided if you’d only listened to me,Sheldon
2024,why would you do that,Sheldon
2025,you managed the situation,Sheldon
2026,so my mother thought i was incapable of finding a mate and my mate thinks i’m incapable of running my own life,Sheldon
2027,i have gotten much better at that,Sheldon
2028,what how should i know excited itchy give me the first letter,Sheldon

2031,yeah here i’ll catch you up,Sheldon
2032,how did we get in the car,Sheldon
2033,i was acting odd intentionally,Sheldon
2034,well there’s really not much left to tell i decided that my mother views me as a child because i never went through a rebellious phase so i got an earring flashback to sheldon screaming my mother made me take it out flashback to sheldon screaming amy put alcohol on it flashback to sheldon screaming and here we are,Sheldon
2035,i don’t understand what’s wrong with socks,Sheldon
2036,so bernadette if i express interest in your baby will you promise not to make me touch it,Sheldon
2037,hey how’s life with your baby,Sheldon
2038,to this day i’ve never touched stuart,Sheldon
2039,wait so how does the story end is the baby a jerk or is bernadette a bad mother,Sheldon
2040,what is there another twist coming is the baby not theirs at all,Sheldon
2041,it says here that up to of new mothers experience baby blues and that the best thing to do is reassure them that they’re doing a good job bernadette you are doing a good job,Sheldon
2042,thank you internet i’m telling you with the right youtube video i can give howard a vasectomy,Sheldon
2043,oh a small human wreaks havoc on his wife’s genitals and he gets time off,Sheldon
2044,we have people over all the time we have the maintenance people the pizza delivery man that ups driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging,Sheldon
2045,all right fine let’s say that we were to entertain people what type of gathering did you have in mind huh a meal lunch brunch dinner afternoon tea a formal tea hmm is it a party and if so what kind of party is it a cocktail party a tupperware party ooh is it a surprise party oh i hope it’s not a west coast party ’cause according to the man on the radio a west coast party don’t stop,Sheldon
2046,oh don’t be you get your hopes up i knock them down that’s called teamwork,Sheldon
2047,you expressed an interest in having people over and i feel i dismissed it too quickly so i took matters into my own hands and i arranged a brunch,Sheldon

2049,yes oh fun story she grew up with ten siblings or possibly penguins her english is atrocious,Sheldon
2050,well for our first time hosting i thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run you know like how i practiced for that halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station,Sheldon
2051,you never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station,Sheldon
2052,oh well the real surprise is how surprised you are that i’m great at surprises,Sheldon

2064,oh thank you,Sheldon
2065,well no that’s not true i mean sometimes it’s koothrappali but we’re not supposed to say that ’cause he’s a minority,Sheldon
2066,stuart wait i do know what it feels like to be left out,Sheldon
2067,all right this is about me and him you’re not part of it stuart perhaps we do take you for granted and that is not acceptable please know that you truly are a valuable member of our social group,Sheldon
2068,you know in fact i’d like to propose a toast to stuart a fine man a good friend and a wonderful guest,Sheldon

2084,yeah we could get thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress,Sheldon
2085,so,Sheldon
2086,i am terrified of stepping on a nail and falling into a butt crack,Sheldon
2087,you know if you’d like i could call your landlord and complain,Sheldon
2088,oh i don’t mind i’m very good at complaining if it were an olympic sport i’d complain about what a stupid sport it is and then i’d take home the gold,Sheldon
2089,is it me or are you purposely changing the subject,Sheldon
2090,i have a feeling you’re still doing it but i find that topic irresistible so now in ancient mesopotamia the king referred to the people as his property,Sheldon
2091,i’m concerned about amy she’s acting a bit odd lately,Sheldon
2092,her behaviour no i have the feeling that she’s hiding something,Sheldon
2093,well whatever it is it’s troubling me and i can’t eat i can’t sleep and don’t even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements,Sheldon
2094,why would she keep something from me you know i shared my body with that woman and my netflix password they recommended stella got her groove back because of her,Sheldon
2095,i don’t understand,Sheldon
2096,so she’s deceiving me in order to spend more time with me,Sheldon
2097,oh well i feel both flattered and hurt like when people say i look like that skeleton from nightmare before christmas,Sheldon
2098,well i won’t tolerate deception in my relationship i have no choice but to confront her,Sheldon

2100,it’s khoovakh,Sheldon
2101,no no he’s over there,Sheldon
2102,are you going to confront penny,Sheldon
2103,hmm you know perhaps instead of confronting them we should see how far they’re willing to spin their tangled webs like that spiderman action figure that used to be on your desk,Sheldon
2104,excellent i’m very hungry speaking of which what’s going on with your apartment,Sheldon
2105,interesting very interesting,Sheldon

2123,of course there’s there’s always your apartment,Sheldon
2124,i hate your apartment,Sheldon
2125,well i suppose we could find a whole new place you know and technically we don’t even have to stay in pasadena we could we could move to altadena or a place that doesn’t even end in dena,Sheldon
2126,but what if we move and we don’t like it what if there’s a smoker in the building or pets or there could be mould there could be traffic noise i’m gonna have to learn a whole new bus route are you trying to soothe me by singing the star trek theme as a lullaby,Sheldon
2127,i’m not a child don’t do that,Sheldon
2128,i’m struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom,Sheldon
2129,i need to see it while i’m gone don’t breathe on my pillow,Sheldon
2130,that’s my girl what on earth what is going on,Sheldon
2131,no,Sheldon

2289,and welcome to a special retrospective where we will take a look back at the history of fun with flags on an episode we’re calling…,Sheldon
2290,mind you when we say behind the flags we don’t literally mean these flags that’s just where we have dinner,Sheldon
2291,so let’s hear from some people who were there at the very start how howard flashback sounds,Sheldon
2292,just roll the clip on voiceover so tell us in your own words about that magical moment when fun with flags was born,Sheldon
2293,sure you do i was telling you both the story about how haiti and lichtenstein discovered they had the same flag it was at the summer olympics of and two plucky nations…,Sheldon
2294,oh and do you remember what you said,Sheldon
2295,and that’s exactly what i did i found a lot of someones,Sheldon
2296,and now we’re going to turn it over to you the viewers to call in and share your favourite fun with flags moments,Sheldon
2297,hello bert what is your flagrelated comment or query,Sheldon
2298,bert you’re tying up the line my apologies to all of you trying to call in with legitimate flag comments,Sheldon
2299,where’s howard,Sheldon
2300,oh let’s take advantage of his absence and tell the kinds of jokes only physicists get i’ll go first okay here uh heisenberg is pulled over by a police officer and the policeman says did you know you were going miles per hour and heisenberg says darn it now i don’t know where i am,Sheldon
2301,oh hello,Sheldon
2302,ahahah he’s a geologist and i have more physics jokes,Sheldon
2303,yeah which he rudely announced on my flag show people were so upset about it no one else called in the rest of the night,Sheldon
2304,hold on we don’t know anything about this woman,Sheldon
2305,is she a geologist,Sheldon
2306,oh great see you at seven,Sheldon
2307,she’s younger and far more attractive than he is they’re copying you two,Sheldon
2308,bert rebecca i’d like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier,Sheldon
2309,see it was fine i didn’t need a timeout,Sheldon
2310,you made me sit on the stairs and think about what i did,Sheldon
2311,what’d you do delete your photo,Sheldon
2312,fine,Sheldon
2313,aw man,Sheldon
2314,i’d say she’s copying you again but i’m getting tired of sitting in the hall,Sheldon
2315,your first date did you even measure her walls,Sheldon
2316,who’s ready to laugh,Sheldon
2317,okay so feynman einstein and schrodinger walk into a bar feynman says it appears,Sheldon
2318,that’s a good one okay now leonard you tell a joke,Sheldon
2319,comments from our behind the flags retrospective get this people are calling it the longest one yet,Sheldon
2320,he’s not wrong it was your crackpot idea that he deserves love,Sheldon
2321,you and leonard don’t have anything in common maybe you should break up,Sheldon
2322,actually our friendship group is at capacity but if anybody drops out you’re at the top of the list unless it’s raj in which case we’ll probably get a person of colour,Sheldon
2323,so he’s using his money to attract a mate is that any different than me using my intelligence to attract amy or leonard using his power of grovelling to get penny,Sheldon
2324,oh so many things her mind her kindness and especially her body,Sheldon
2325,hello i’m dr sheldon cooper,Sheldon
2326,based on the glowing reception of our recent behind the flags retrospective we thought you might like to see how it all came together,Sheldon
2327,ooh we already have our first call,Sheldon
2328,everything is stupid and i want to go home,Sheldon
2329,hey it’s not even called the genius grant it’s the macarthur fellowship just like it’s not frankenstein it’s frankenstein’s monster which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there and if anyone’s a genius it’s me for the way i brought that full circle,Sheldon
2330,oh good maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under,Sheldon
2331,i know how to behave,Sheldon

2339,yeh why eh why oh that’s why,Sheldon
2340,i hope you’re happy making me read this bert’s work is remarkable and i’m more upset than ever this is worse than when i had to admit that cedric the entertainer’s actually entertaining,Sheldon
2341,yeah well i am angry and you telling me not to be angry makes me angry and do you know how hearing myself say the word angry over and over makes me feel,Sheldon
2342,that’s a good idea i guess everyone’s having them now,Sheldon
2343,fine you can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons,Sheldon
2344,i admire you leonard,Sheldon

2349,ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow…,Sheldon
2350,i tried to let go of anger and threw a rock into my foot,Sheldon
2351,yeah but you’ve got all those things and no one’s lining up to be you,Sheldon
2352,uh do you really think calling me names is helpful,Sheldon
2353,maybe you’re right,Sheldon
2354,thank you penny you know i just need to keep reminding myself that bert’s success is not my failure,Sheldon
2355,and that men of his large stature are more susceptible to a wide array of lifethreatening diseases,Sheldon
2356,top of the afternoon gentlemen,Sheldon
2357,well it’s a new day i have a new outlook you know i realized i don’t need to worry about other people i just need to think more about myself,Sheldon

2398,look look here i am standing next to the incubator uh here is a microscopic view of the cells,Sheldon
2399,aw yeah this little guy can already recognize electronically transmitted images faster than any other sample in amy’s lab,Sheldon
2400,yeah i have to say it is nice to share this experience with someone who’s on the same journey although right now ours is testing off the charts while yours is floating around in its own waste,Sheldon
2401,well i didn’t make you waddle up four flights of stairs for the heck of it,Sheldon
2402,yeah but ours can recognize a specific data stream among background noise,Sheldon
2403,ours doesn’t need an immune system because it lives in a stateoftheart german incubator,Sheldon
2404,okay fine let’s just agree that both creations are special in their own way and it is foolish to try and compare them although we didn’t need to have sex with howard for ours so we win,Sheldon
2405,would you look at that the image we gave it was white noise and it still managed to reconstruct it,Sheldon
2406,yeah we need to stop for magnets on the way home this is going right on the fridge,Sheldon
2407,oh i am and you realize what the next step is,Sheldon
2408,uh no we lock that door lower our underpants a little and make a baby,Sheldon

2424,i have a plan to work on both projects simultaneously and for your information the summer conference on algebraic topology at caltech is nerd prom,Sheldon
2425,well i’m not needed at both places at the same time and i can also free up extra hours with simple tricks such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point,Sheldon
2426,soon see i could’ve said in the near future but i didn’t say in the near future because in the near future is three more words than soon in one the two near three future four see in the near future is four soon is just one four is more than one saving time already,Sheldon

2500,uh wait before we eat i have a little welcome to the building gift for raj,Sheldon
2501,well i had some of my best ideas in that room and i’m sure you will too,Sheldon
2502,well i know this is a difficult time for you you’re losing your apartment you’re in debt and you just you must be humiliated,Sheldon
2503,oh good grief she is such a stickler for citing sources those were amy’s words,Sheldon
2504,i know i know good grief was originally said by charlie brown geez,Sheldon
2505,can you believe this guy,Sheldon
2506,i thought that was gonna break the other way,Sheldon
2507,fine you took my room you turned my friends against me i hope you’re happy,Sheldon
2508,how come he can say it and i can’t,Sheldon
2509,honestly i’ve been better do you have time leonard says you’re very busy these days,Sheldon
2510,well our friend raj moved into my old room and it’s brought up a lot of negative feelings for me,Sheldon
2511,beverley you know i hold you in high esteem can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer and get to the part where you tell me the answer,Sheldon
2512,i have,Sheldon
2513,i hadn’t thought about that,Sheldon
2514,i had no idea all our relationships were such a disaster boy you’re good,Sheldon
2515,hey raj i owe you an apology look could you please put your dog on a leash,Sheldon
2516,well then at least hold her still so i can pretend she’s stuffed raj i let my emotions get the best of me and i unfairly took it out on you,Sheldon
2517,no i can’t take all the credit i spoke with leonard’s mother and she made me feel better,Sheldon
2518,beverly pointed out that i’m experiencing insecurities in my relationship with amy in the same way that leonard and penny are in their relationship,Sheldon
2519,yes you’re fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems it used to be me now it’s raj and his attack tribble anyway i’m sorry for everything oh and fyi if you cry while they’re fighting they’ll take you to mcdonald’s,Sheldon
2520,i can’t sleep,Sheldon
2521,beverley believes i unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch,Sheldon
2522,yes i don’t care for unconscious thoughts my brain and i are best friends it should tell me everything,Sheldon
2523,what if she’s correct doesn’t that say something troubling about us,Sheldon
2524,that is true did you know i figured out in which order i would eat all my friends in the event of an apocalypse,Sheldon
2525,penny would be the entree then leonard’s basically a cheese course and because i love you you’re dessert,Sheldon
2526,amy quick lock the door,Sheldon
2527,you know what i’m proud of us yeah with penny and leonard taking in raj and stuart living with howard and bernadette we’re the only couple of our social group who doesn’t need to fill the holes in their relationship with a third party,Sheldon
2528,how are you settling in,Sheldon
2529,now i’ve learned some fun facts about new jersey to help you make small talk would you like to know the state bird or the murder rate they’re both shocking,Sheldon
2530,well i’m a lot less likely to see an eastern goldfinch or be murdered i’ll tell you that,Sheldon
2531,i miss you too,Sheldon
2532,i’m sorry you had to go through that,Sheldon
2533,you know you just split an infinitive,Sheldon
2534,i am it is naughty to put an adverb between the word to and the verb stem,Sheldon
2535,i’m going to admonish you,Sheldon
2536,that’s the only kind of admonishing i do,Sheldon
2537,gentlemen you may remember dr nowitzki she’s back at caltech for her postdoc,Sheldon
2538,oh thanks dr nowitzki’s going to tell me about the work she did at cern and she brought me this dutyfree toblerone,Sheldon
2539,let’s sit somewhere else,Sheldon
2540,so tell me about your scalar dark energy experiment,Sheldon
2541,oh you must be one of those dessert before dinner people,Sheldon
2542,and get this i saw an articulating ladder with dualleg leveling which delivers stability and adaptability to uneven terrain,Sheldon
2543,yeah raj made the funniest joke he said which is the best ladder to use to hang myself,Sheldon
2544,oh not at all i’ve had outings with leonard and raj in the evening and oh i had lunch,Sheldon
2545,oh dr nowitzki is a woman,Sheldon
2546,many years ago back when she was a grad student she’s always been a huge fan of my work and now she’s doing research at caltech,Sheldon
2547,yes i think you’d like her she’s extremely intelligent just like you unlike you she’s tall blonde and used to be an olympic swimmer,Sheldon
2548,hey everybody this is my friend dr nowitzki,Sheldon
2549,we just went swimming,Sheldon
2550,i was scared but i told myself it’s just a big bathtub then i got scared again ’cause there are all these strangers in my bathtub,Sheldon
2551,well i was hiding from a bee but it still counts,Sheldon
2552,yes we skyped this morning and i’m sure i’ll check in with her before i go to sleep,Sheldon
2553,that is true she keeps asking how long amy’s going to be gone,Sheldon
2554,leonard your wife is sitting right here what are you doing,Sheldon
2555,she was part of the american team at cern,Sheldon
2556,do you know i’ve corresponded with peter higgs would you like to see some of his letters,Sheldon
2557,i’ll get them,Sheldon
2558,oh fun like a play date,Sheldon
2559,here you go,Sheldon
2560,hmm oh no no no they’re from many famous people see oh like this one this is from patrick stewart it says if i come to his house again i get to meet his dogs oh excuse me,Sheldon
2561,oh hello amy,Sheldon
2562,i miss you too hey this is good timing remember that dr nowitzki i told you about she’s right here,Sheldon
2563,what is leonard doing calling you at this hour,Sheldon
2564,i must tell you that seems a little inappropriate don’t you agree,Sheldon
2565,see we both think so,Sheldon
2566,hey i hate to break up the party but amy says i’m tired and have to go to bed,Sheldon
2567,of course,Sheldon
2568,that was fun it was like mario kart,Sheldon
2569,bye,Sheldon
2570,what is this about leonard and amy i don’t like it either,Sheldon
2571,that doesn’t make any sense she knows i have a girlfriend,Sheldon
2572,that may be true but dr nowitzki’s just a friend in fact i wouldn’t have even noticed she’s a woman if she hadn’t worn that bathing suit that highlighted her bosom,Sheldon
2573,i already do,Sheldon
2574,because there’s only one of me i’m more valuable,Sheldon
2575,although amy’s already taken me out of my package and played with me,Sheldon
2576,penny look i appreciate your concern but i don’t think that’s what’s happening,Sheldon
2577,i think dr nowitzki is a friendly colleague i think you and leonard need to see a marriage counsellor and i need to update my résumé to include swimming as a special skill,Sheldon
2578,uh breakfast yes lunch no i did have a cough drop but that really rides the line between sucking and eating,Sheldon
2579,how thoughtful thank you,Sheldon
2580,and i with you question are you seeking a romantic relationship with me,Sheldon
2581,well that would raise a number of problems we’re colleagues i’m currently in a relation… excuse me a moment,Sheldon
2582,knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy will you marry me,Sheldon
2583,things have been going really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope,Sheldon
2584,oh the project is classified i can’t tell you oh i suppose i could redact the classified parts all right um i came up with an elegant solution to the honks horn i used the honks horn and then i honks horn and that did it car passes honking horn wow i wonder what they’re redacting,Sheldon
2585,oh very well what have you been working on and feel free to honk during the boring parts,Sheldon
2586,so you’re attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain,Sheldon
2587,well what do you know here i was waiting to be bored with biology and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy which unlike my body is an okay place to tickle,Sheldon
2588,gentlemen the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon,Sheldon
2589,yeah i picked it up without thinking about it which raises a neuroscientific question when did i decide to pick it up,Sheldon
2590,amy is studying the time lag between intent and awareness and i realized that applies to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics now i recognize there will be a time lag between me saying that and you googling what it means so i’ll wait,Sheldon
2591,well don’t get me wrong neurobiology’s nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff but you know when it connects to physics gas up the ford martha we’re going for a drive,Sheldon
2592,i was thinking about your experiment on the neuroscience of decision making and i realized if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness in the copenhagen interpretation,Sheldon
2593,it could be the most inspired combination since i mixed red icee into my blue icee it was like drinking two sevenths of the rainbow,Sheldon
2594,yeah and this one won’t stain my teeth purple,Sheldon
2595,that is a valid point perhaps we should establish some ground rules,Sheldon
2596,all right let’s start right now uh rule number one no using sexuality to get your way,Sheldon
2597,is it,Sheldon
2598,i believe i’ve made some progress on our ground rules,Sheldon
2599,okay uh number one in matters of physics i have the final say in matters of neuroscience you have the final say unless i disagree oh here number two when we publish,Sheldon
2600,oh of course i’ll get that back like all my underwear that notebook says property of sheldon cooper,Sheldon
2601,i’d write that down but i can’t now can i,Sheldon
2602,thank you you are a good citizen told you go ahead throw my underwear out the window same thing’s gonna happen,Sheldon
2603,fire away,Sheldon
2604,that’s smart because sheldon amy,Sheldon
2605,aw someone drew a penis in it,Sheldon
2606,i’m sorry go ahead,Sheldon
2607,ooh that sounds fun now we’re talking about real treats right not bible verses like my mother used to give me,Sheldon
2608,biology and physics coming together this is like the peanut butter cup of the mind oh i know what i want my treat to be,Sheldon
2609,yes this is remarkable,Sheldon
2610,by the way your name can go first,Sheldon
2611,yeah the math is so inelegant i’m not even sure it makes sense,Sheldon
2612,can you stop breathing so loud i can hear your nose whistling,Sheldon
2613,all right either blow your nose or teach it to play camptown races,Sheldon
2614,no i can still hear it oh wait that’s me never mind it’s fine,Sheldon
2615,hold on i see what’s wrong here we did the propagation only to the occipital lobe not to the prefrontal cortex,Sheldon
2616,oh that is much better yeah boy if good ideas came out of your brain the way mucus comes out of your nose we’d be in good shape,Sheldon
2617,just because i am easily bothered by light heat sound smell and the way birds look at me does not mean i’m sensitive,Sheldon
2618,that is a daring and insightful solution,Sheldon
2619,what if the fighting is the reason we’re making progress,Sheldon
2620,well if that’s the case then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture,Sheldon
2621,it seems we have a choice to make abandon all ground rules in the name of science or give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship,Sheldon
2622,science it is,Sheldon
2623,name calling that is perfect now when i get to this equation here really let me have it you know if it helps i’m not the sharpest dresser,Sheldon
2624,can you read them back,Sheldon
2625,excellent excellent and on a related point you’re going down punk,Sheldon
2626,i love that one,Sheldon
2627,yeah that list is strong like your mother’s urge to be promiscuous with sailors,Sheldon
2628,uhhuh interesting okay,Sheldon
2629,let me put it this way do you own a barrel and suspenders,Sheldon
2630,i’m not wearing this visor to play women’s golf,Sheldon
2631,well his rent and car lease are exceedingly high you couple that with his penchant for dining out and shopping,Sheldon
2632,he also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt,Sheldon
2633,what emergency happened at the la zoo,Sheldon
2634,no absolutely not you can’t afford to hire someone who’ll forbid you from spending your money on foolish expenses that is a foolish expense and i forbid it,Sheldon
2635,he sounds like a sociopath,Sheldon
2636,you’re talking about me very funny although i would enjoy drawing up a budget and forcing raj to adhere to it without an ounce of compassion,Sheldon
2637,very well hey comiccon tickets go on sale this friday you can’t buy one,Sheldon
2638,she’s gonna hate waiting in line for the panels,Sheldon
2639,she’s gonna hate the panels,Sheldon
2640,you can always watch the panels online oh boy we do say that a lot,Sheldon
2641,you put me in charge of your finances if you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over you should have asked leonard,Sheldon
2642,your father may have spoiled you but i won’t if you want a ticket to comiccon i suggest you figure out a way to earn the money yourself,Sheldon
2643,i’m gonna go as dumbledore,Sheldon
2644,that’s probably my fault she may have heard about my cool dumbledore costume,Sheldon
2645,if i may speak for comiccon we don’t want that either,Sheldon
2646,no but it’s honest and it sounds like you could use a little more honesty in your relationship,Sheldon
2647,i’m always honest with amy the other day she said she was selfconscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder and i said you know you can call that a beauty mark all you want when there’s hair growing out of it that’s a mole,Sheldon
2648,i should hope so when she called me an insensitive jerk i’d like to think she meant it,Sheldon
2649,very well prepare for a long night of deceit,Sheldon
2650,i was talking about leonard and if make up is so truthful why is it called concealer,Sheldon
2651,he doesn’t really want penny to go to comiccon he’s just doing it to make her happy,Sheldon
2652,so they’re both trying to make each other happy and the end result is they make each other sad that’s hilarious i can’t wait to tell them,Sheldon
2653,why,Sheldon
2654,well if you haven’t noticed i’ve been between them for the last ten years,Sheldon
2655,hello,Sheldon
2656,are you listening to this they deceive each other about everything,Sheldon
2657,this is an interesting way to stay out of it,Sheldon
2658,yeah well get this neither does penny that’s why she doesn’t want to go you set ’em up i knock ’em down good job,Sheldon
2659,not entirely the fight over who’s going to drive is still…,Sheldon
2660,well with as much debt as you have probably not next year either,Sheldon
2661,hold on is it back pay or is it a gift,Sheldon
2662,when the irs questions us in separate rooms we need to have our stories straight,Sheldon
2663,i’m a big boy and if i missed one i’d throw a bigboy tantrum,Sheldon
2664,nuts to that i’m going to comiccon,Sheldon
2665,not necessarily i have four months to find some new friends,Sheldon
2666,that’s very kind of you stuart check back in with me in july,Sheldon
2667,there’s my pretty girlfriend,Sheldon
2668,what can’t a man just be happy to see his woman and pat her on her second most erogenous ballandsocket joint,Sheldon
2669,well maybe what’s in my pants will change your mind it’s a list of this year’s panelists it’s long isn’t it,Sheldon
2670,oh while you do that i am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic byproducts of the day’s thoughts,Sheldon
2671,it’s called sleep and it’s my bedtime nightynight y’all,Sheldon

2688,gentlemen i am ready to work to quote the martian let’s science the faeces out of this that’s the martian the book and the martian the movie not marvin the martian although to quote marvin the martian i claim this planet in the name of mars,Sheldon

2691,no i can do this i just i just need another energy drink oh no,Sheldon
2692,i want another one,Sheldon
2693,that’s a craving that’s a sign of chemical dependency,Sheldon
2694,no i know but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure i mean crack cocaine nicotine pringles you know once one pops one just can’t stop,Sheldon
2695,you want to bet oh great now i’m addicted to gambling,Sheldon

2702,with what,Sheldon
2703,i thought i didn’t have a problem,Sheldon
2704,leonard can i ask you a question,Sheldon
2705,howard can i ask you a question,Sheldon
2706,all right i’ll just toss this out to the room um i was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps now i couldn’t find a caffeine patch but i did find what claims to be a mindboosting caffeine suppository you know the interesting fact about the rectum…,Sheldon
2707,you don’t shove them they come with an easyglide applicator,Sheldon
2708,i can’t,Sheldon
2709,no i can’t figure out the math i’ve been racking my brain for days and i’ve got nothing,Sheldon
2710,i can’t do it i’m not as smart as i think i am i’m so sorry this is all my fault,Sheldon
2711,but what if we can’t,Sheldon
2712,he said start with it not end with it,Sheldon
2713,the computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought,Sheldon
2714,we we really appreciate it,Sheldon
2715,popcorn’s on me,Sheldon
2716,look at this elon musk has a theory that we’re all just characters in some advanced civilization’s video game,Sheldon
2717,well he doesn’t say it’s a good game,Sheldon
2718,oh what did he say,Sheldon
2719,that doesn’t sound terrifying,Sheldon
2720,gentlemen i think we are losing sight of the real issue we are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs in the militaryindustrial complex isn’t that exciting,Sheldon
2721,not at all in star wars when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation harassing civilians didn’t you ever think hey that could be me,Sheldon
2722,okay howard’s on board what do you think leonard,Sheldon
2723,we don’t need howard’s cousin no we have me,Sheldon
2724,i am not a knowitall i’m a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when they’re wrong,Sheldon
2725,or in german a besserwisser,Sheldon
2726,i don’t see how a tax lawyer from fort lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property,Sheldon
2727,hello,Sheldon
2728,don’t sign anything that’s your advice okay so uh if during this meeting one of us were to say complete an oil painting you’d recommend that we leave that unsigned,Sheldon
2729,that’s what you said,Sheldon
2730,this must be how you practice law in boca raton by saying things you don’t mean and meaning things you don’t say,Sheldon
2731,you don’t need him i’ll represent you,Sheldon
2732,i don’t understand why i can’t talk at this meeting,Sheldon
2733,okay quick question am i allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel,Sheldon
2734,am i allowed to inform him that colonel sanders was never actually in the military,Sheldon
2735,fine ooh can i use texttospeech software,Sheldon
2736,strangled sound,Sheldon
2737,yeah we’ll do it in two hi i’m dr sheldon cooper i’m the actual brains behind this project also engineers aren’t real scientists mit’s a trade school and the death star is from star wars not star trek but otherwise thank you for your service,Sheldon
2738,hello,Sheldon
2739,oh leonard’s mad at me so i’m making him lemon bars,Sheldon
2740,not really but i’m mad at him too so lemon bars it is,Sheldon
2741,they made me promise i wouldn’t talk,Sheldon
2742,well now see you knew what was gonna happen why didn’t they anyway now we’re committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame and everyone’s upset with me,Sheldon
2743,mm if it makes you feel any better a parasitoid wasp known as oobius depressus has been rediscovered after years of presumed extinction,Sheldon
2744,why would your bernadette thing make me feel better at least mine was educational,Sheldon
2745,look i’m sorry tell me why bernadette is upset with you,Sheldon
2746,why would you do that,Sheldon
2747,see that’s exactly what happened to me except that i said it on purpose and i have no regrets,Sheldon
2748,i never realized this building was classified,Sheldon
2749,the way you put away those lemon bars perhaps that’s a good thing,Sheldon
2750,why it clearly doesn’t work,Sheldon
2751,impressive,Sheldon
2752,there’s no way,Sheldon
2753,its weight and smoothness along with the slight concavity of the mirror means it can spin for a long time,Sheldon
2754,kind of busy right now,Sheldon
2755,he’s not gonna make it,Sheldon
2756,you know deepsea divers holding their breath for several minutes have shown elevated markers of a protein that can signal brain damage,Sheldon
2757,it’s slowing down,Sheldon
2758,he’s not gonna make it,Sheldon
2759,oh i won’t i only eat equilateral triangles isosceles isosceles oh scalene you didn’t see that,Sheldon
2760,why,Sheldon
2761,i have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise,Sheldon
2762,if the judge couldn’t explain it to me i don’t see how you will,Sheldon
2763,hello,Sheldon
2764,well have a lovely evening,Sheldon
2765,if you think that’s more fun than talking to zachary quinto through a stall door you’re crazy,Sheldon
2766,msn search altavista and ask jeeves you,Sheldon
2767,bert i insist that you join us,Sheldon
2768,not at all amy,Sheldon
2769,well i could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad,Sheldon
2770,you want me to look at him and listen to him,Sheldon
2771,actually we met online,Sheldon
2772,although unlike your date she actually showed up oh he looks sad again,Sheldon
2773,no no i only told leonard howard raj kripke uh professor wu professor klein and a lunch lady in the cafeteria how everyone else found out is a mystery to me,Sheldon
2774,why aren’t you talking to me,Sheldon
2775,oh well now i’m sorry i asked,Sheldon
2776,what is there to gossip about we barely have one,Sheldon
2777,is it safe to assume you’re not speaking to me again if you’re not answering because you’re not speaking to me perhaps we could come up with a signal that works,Sheldon
2778,well wait this is our first fight as a couple who live together,Sheldon
2779,i’m not sure of the protocol television teaches us that the man’s supposed to sleep on the couch but of the two of us you’re clearly more sofasized,Sheldon
2780,this isn’t fair you’ve discussed aspects of our physical relationship with penny,Sheldon
2781,that lady has a name i don’t know what it is but one time i accidentally called her mom,Sheldon
2782,knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy,Sheldon
2783,not exactly the welcome wagon but i’ll take it,Sheldon
2784,i’m mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed i call these circles zones of privacy don’t google that unless you want to see pictures of people’s genitals this circle contains only me and you it represents subjects we only share with each other details of physical intimacy bathroom habits although as i’m saying it i may need to add dr fink in here,Sheldon
2785,no i was just excited to list him as a friend,Sheldon
2786,i’m sorry you were embarrassed and now i understand that some things are just between you and me and in the event of redness and swelling dr fink,Sheldon
2787,that’s reserved for thoughts i don’t share with anyone,Sheldon
2788,of course,Sheldon
2789,no they’re private,Sheldon
2790,a little,Sheldon
2791,fine two years ago i got my driver’s license,Sheldon
2792,i like being chauffeured around it makes me feel important,Sheldon
2793,no you didn’t but keep in mind i felt extremely important,Sheldon
2794,excuse me may i have your attention please i have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with amy farrah fowler has become water cooler gossip and i just want to say shame on all of you we’re scientists our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge not the intimate details of other people’s lives,Sheldon
2795,thank you bert you’re a good man that woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out,Sheldon
2796,oh oh i’m sorry correction that woman not only had vigorous coitus with bert she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done – that better,Sheldon
2797,all right well to sum up focus on science keep your nose out of other people’s business and uh whoa for a good time call bert,Sheldon
2798,well last night amy was angry with me because i’d been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters,Sheldon
2799,oh i know that now at first i thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps but it turns out no she was genuinely mortified,Sheldon
2800,that’s not a problem we can figure this out what are the reasons women reject raj,Sheldon
2801,doesn’t like games that’s one,Sheldon
2802,of course you’re fine not every member of a species finds a mate sir isaac newton died a virgin look at the contributions he made,Sheldon
2803,so now you think you’re better than isaac newton oh no wonder women don’t like you,Sheldon
2804,what he said he was fine,Sheldon
2805,oh that’s a paradox i mean if you meant what you just said then that means you may not have meant what you just said,Sheldon
2806,well i thought we were having a nice conversation but it turns out i was being offensive,Sheldon
2807,yeah,Sheldon
2808,we were discussing raj’s recent breakup and apparently i was insensitive to him,Sheldon
2809,don’t fall for it he’ll get you to compare him to a dead virgin and suddenly you’re the bad guy,Sheldon
2810,then why didn’t you say that,Sheldon
2811,well i would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind,Sheldon
2812,well it certainly would be easier you have no idea what it’s like to struggle with recognizing emotional cues,Sheldon
2813,thank you,Sheldon
2814,okay now you’re just showing off,Sheldon
2815,a machine that reads emotions is intriguing it could help me be a more considerate friend,Sheldon
2816,it could also help me identify my enemies discover their fears and then i could use those fears to destroy them,Sheldon
2817,you could make it a train room,Sheldon
2818,i know and amy says i can’t have a train room,Sheldon
2819,wonderful although i’m not sure how i feel about being used as a guinea pig,Sheldon
2820,yes now when the robots rise up they’ll know that i’ve been rooting for them the whole time,Sheldon
2821,you are happy,Sheldon
2822,aw somebody’s ignoring their tiny needle teeth but all right,Sheldon
2823,sad,Sheldon
2824,oh that makes sense ’cause she’s gone and you miss her,Sheldon
2825,and you’re worried that turkey neck is in your future what now see now it says you’re mad make up your mind,Sheldon
2826,hey leonard if you’re happy and you know it no need to clap your hands because i have an emotion detector,Sheldon
2827,surprisingly well,Sheldon
2828,no wait uh hold on oh what you are aren’t you sweet,Sheldon
2829,oh ooh and that makes leonard angry,Sheldon
2830,what leonard please i know an angry face when i see it it’s this red frowny guy on my phone,Sheldon
2831,yes,Sheldon
2832,it’s like you’re twins,Sheldon
2833,well hey now she’s angry too this thing works like gangbusters,Sheldon
2834,he’s still mad,Sheldon
2835,you first,Sheldon
2836,hey i shared my honey nut cheerios with you,Sheldon
2837,you are lucky that this feelings machine doesn’t have feelings,Sheldon
2838,gladly can we storm out,Sheldon
2839,fine i’ll just give them the finger,Sheldon
2840,not really,Sheldon
2841,i wish i never tried that device and i know i said the same thing after the massage chair but this time i mean it,Sheldon
2842,it’s more than that it’s me i always knew i had trouble recognizing other people’s emotions but that machine just made it so real,Sheldon
2843,i thought i was getting better at it but clearly i’m not,Sheldon
2844,yeah but that’s shooting fish in a barrel you’re kind of a sad sack i’m sorry i shouldn’t have said that i’m just upset,Sheldon
2845,i feel the same way about you now put your glasses back on you look weird,Sheldon
2846,yes,Sheldon
2847,oh it’s fine you needed a suitcase i wasn’t home you borrowed a suitcase,Sheldon
2848,oh well i thought we were going in order,Sheldon
2849,yeah well you should be your socks were still in it i had to throw it away anyway i uh trust that you’ve resolved your conflict,Sheldon
2850,uh guys it sounds like you’re getting angry again,Sheldon
2851,yes i don’t need an emotion machine i am one,Sheldon
2852,i did you know i’m not even sure how accurate it was i took it to the train store it said everyone was sad,Sheldon
2853,hey uh bernadette let’s test this theory what do you think i’m feeling right now,Sheldon
2854,keep filling this one with babies she’s good,Sheldon
2855,gentlemen we need to stop immediately,Sheldon
2856,i’m looking at the math and i think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller,Sheldon
2857,shame on you where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude i’ll tell you we would have the standard and the miniature poodle but no toy or teacup which by the way is not an officially recognized breed but that’s just poodle politics,Sheldon
2858,fine candy bars now do you enjoy a fun size i know you do,Sheldon
2859,i don’t want to go home,Sheldon
2860,then what,Sheldon
2861,oh that was my sixth trip to the bathroom as long as that’s not a urinary tract infection that’s a personal best,Sheldon
2862,really,Sheldon
2863,congratulations the bearer of this certificate is entitled to the ultimate train experience at the nevada northern railway you are at the throttle you are the engineer you are running the locomotive this doesn’t happen very often but here comes a hug oh dear i have to tinkle again,Sheldon
2864,you’ll never believe it leonard gave me the most incredible gift a trip to a historic railway and i get to operate an actual locomotive,Sheldon
2865,no idea all i know is i’m gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day,Sheldon
2866,oh no it’s not just me no the railway is four hours from the nearest airport and guess who gets to drive me,Sheldon
2867,you,Sheldon
2868,oh oh and guess where we get to sleep our choice of a turnofthecentury railway bunkhouse or a working caboose now the problem with a caboose is there’s no bathroom but the problem with the bunkhouse is it’s not a caboose on the first day i get to drive a steam engine oh and the second day a diesel engine oh and if i volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork they’ll let me stay as long as i want so you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives,Sheldon
2869,oh get this i get to take a test based on a page manual i get to learn things like hand signals ooh there’s forward uh reverse set the brakes are you done yet you’re missing,Sheldon
2870,oh hey if you knocked i couldn’t hear you i’m welding this locomotive engine and if you didn’t knock how about some manners,Sheldon
2871,i said to myself i think i can i think i can and then i couldn’t so i paid two men who promised not to come rob us later,Sheldon
2872,interesting well so i was right,Sheldon
2873,well i would love to help you but since i discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine i don’t think i can go back to theory i’m an engineer now and hey just to be clear a train engineer not that goofy kind you are,Sheldon
2874,sorry i need to work on this engine so when i get to the train yard i won’t look foolish,Sheldon
2875,leonard in the world of theoretical physics you never finish so much is unprovable but when i was studying that railway guide it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked then it clacked then it clicked then it clacked clickclack clicketyclack and here we are whoowhoo,Sheldon
2876,well good for you guys look i have a grease smudge on my hand and i’m okay with it,Sheldon
2877,no thanks i’m busy trying to fix this fuel pump,Sheldon
2878,oh well i guess it’s fixed,Sheldon
2879,that’s wrong,Sheldon
2880,well first of all you can’t use relativistic and nonrelativistic vectors in the same equation,Sheldon
2881,okay but this is the last time nice try blockheads,Sheldon
2882,excuse me i have a girlfriend i’m already king of the train store,Sheldon
2883,oh what choice do i have you need me i’m like the crankshaft of this team,Sheldon
2884,well whatever it is it looks heavy i’m gonna need you two to get it downstairs before amy comes home,Sheldon
2885,i apologize that it’s so warm in here,Sheldon
2886,i’ve worked up a bit of a sweat,Sheldon
2887,may i borrow your water,Sheldon
2888,the light’s green,Sheldon
2889,gps says we’ll be at the railway in three hours,Sheldon
2890,leonard leonard,Sheldon
2891,you realize you and i could become brothers,Sheldon
2892,i hope you’re right ‘cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother’s wife is weird,Sheldon
2893,okay do you think your father’s doing unspeakable things to my mother,Sheldon
2894,are you saying that because the things are unspeakable,Sheldon
2895,very well,Sheldon
2896,hey if you want me to sleep you’re gonna have to stop talking,Sheldon
2897,it was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example,Sheldon
2898,whuh are we still doing the dumb thing okay why what’s wrong,Sheldon
2899,oh golly however did he humiliate you,Sheldon
2900,do i say stop what or just throw in the towel,Sheldon
2901,oh excuse me that is my mother you’re talking about however accurately,Sheldon
2902,and turned their phones off,Sheldon
2903,you know also if they did have coitus we’ll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist,Sheldon
2904,all right so less or equally awkward got it,Sheldon
2905,hello,Sheldon
2906,so did you defile my mother or not,Sheldon
2907,did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold,Sheldon
2908,or what a joy it is to behold my genitals,Sheldon
2909,a man named jesus convinced you to build a church in africa you’re kind of a sucker,Sheldon
2910,what in the chattahoochee national forest in georgia i can’t be the only one that knows that’s halfway,Sheldon
2911,what but he’s a mediocre academic and according to beverley his sexual prowess is subpar he’s basically leonard with a bigger prostate,Sheldon
2912,yes while also getting in a solid dig at you pretty efficient huh,Sheldon
2913,but why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents,Sheldon
2914,great now i have to start all over,Sheldon
2915,you made god sad today mom,Sheldon
2916,well that’s still no reason to rush into anything i mean look at us we took things remarkably slow you and i we didn’t even hold hands for two years,Sheldon
2917,hey hey she’s mine take a cold shower grandpa,Sheldon
2918,why do people cry at weddings,Sheldon
2919,speaking of love stds among the elderly are skyrocketing,Sheldon
2920,yeah excuse me i need to say something to someone pretty special and i just can’t wait any longer,Sheldon
2921,leonard you and i have our ups and downs but i have always considered you my family even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits i don’t always show it but you are of great importance to me both of you,Sheldon
2922,plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy,Sheldon
2923,yes ma’am,Sheldon
2924,well and you need to drive the car and mind your business,Sheldon
2925,what you’re not my mother,Sheldon
2926,yes ma’am,Sheldon
2927,will you two please inform amy how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule,Sheldon
2928,i can if you’d just roll over and accept your fate,Sheldon
2929,oh look who’s in favour of compromise the woman who married leonard hofstadter,Sheldon
2930,well i’m open to that,Sheldon
2931,i think we should see other people,Sheldon
2932,well as a male i have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my dna restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature,Sheldon
2933,don’t blame me blame your pal biology he’s the pervert pulling the strings here,Sheldon
2934,you know people are quick to accuse me of being difficult to live with but the truth is amy is just as challenging,Sheldon
2935,yes,Sheldon
2936,yes,Sheldon
2937,when we’re sleeping she breathes on me one night it got so bad i almost grabbed toto,Sheldon
2938,she’s always complaining about people at work,Sheldon
2939,do you know that when i get out of the shower she eyes me up and down like i’m a piece of meat,Sheldon
2940,i know sometimes i would just like to be appreciated for my mind,Sheldon
2941,have you noticed it’s always an aflat,Sheldon
2942,if we’re just going to drive around aimlessly the least you could do is take me for ice cream,Sheldon
2943,well see why can’t amy be that subservient she has coitus one time suddenly she’s gloria steinem anyway i suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women,Sheldon
2944,being with amy has awoken the sexual creature within when i see a pretty gal walking down the street i think hubba hubba like any other guy,Sheldon
2945,no no if we both like it i’ll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going aw no strawberry,Sheldon
2946,hmm well she spends her whole day scooping one arm’s probably bigger than the other,Sheldon
2947,you are truly wise,Sheldon
2948,i’d say wise beyond your years but you’re getting up there,Sheldon
2949,penny i am going to tell you a story that i’ve never told anyone,Sheldon
2950,i was years old and on spring break from college,Sheldon
2951,i came home early because they ran out of math to teach me,Sheldon
2952,my mother was at bible study i walked in the house expecting to find it empty and i heard a sound coming from my parents’ bedroom when i opened the door i saw my father having relations with another woman,Sheldon
2953,i know it’s also why i never open a door without knocking three times i mean the first,Sheldon
2954,we locked eyes i ran to my room and we never ever spoke of it,Sheldon
2955,since amy and i have been living together we’ve been bickering like my parents used to,Sheldon
2956,yes i need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road,Sheldon
2957,well anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone,Sheldon
2958,i’m sure you’re right i suppose i should apologize to you as well,Sheldon
2959,that must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you please understand that i think of you as more of a nanny,Sheldon
2960,hello,Sheldon
2961,i wanted to apologize for my behaviour today it it was unnecessary this is warm oh and also i am willing to forego the bathroom schedule,Sheldon
2962,amy you should know i was never really interested in seeing other women and to prove how serious i am about us i’m willing to take our relationship to the next level,Sheldon
2963,amy farrah fowler will you share this toothbrush holder with me,Sheldon
2964,amy wake up,Sheldon
2965,it’s midnight happy birthday,Sheldon
2966,this is for you i was going to wrap it but touching scotch tape gives me the heebiejeebies,Sheldon
2967,a functional mri of my brain i did sudoku before they took it so i’d be ripped,Sheldon
2968,and it’s not just an mri the orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because i was thinking of you,Sheldon
2969,we seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities,Sheldon
2970,i didn’t put on my comehither plaid pj’s for nothing,Sheldon
2971,yeah i’m afraid so childbirth looming coitus this is a banner night for female genitals,Sheldon
2972,wolowitz might hand out cigars i had to find my bubble gum cigar so i could join in without looking foolish,Sheldon
2973,i’m starting to rethink the flash onesie i bought this kid,Sheldon
2974,it doesn’t matter what i want it’s your birthday you decide,Sheldon
2975,that’s a bit childish isn’t it,Sheldon
2976,grape i find it the most mild,Sheldon
2977,well i believe we were kissing like randy teenagers and your nose was whistling ever so slightly,Sheldon
2978,oh don’t be you were like a foxy tea kettle,Sheldon
2979,very well,Sheldon
2980,i’m not sure earlier tonight things began organically and now it’s feeling forced like all the pirates of the caribbean sequels,Sheldon
2981,oh i know but just leonard and penny think we’re doing it and i don’t want to disappoint them,Sheldon
2982,no and also i don’t want to disappoint you i you know come on it’s your birthday i can soldier through this,Sheldon
2983,intriguing is back on track a hint that it has something to do with trains,Sheldon
2984,because if it did have to do with trains and you were gonna give…,Sheldon
2985,not even a cozy sleeper car on the orient express,Sheldon
2986,who’s killing the mood now,Sheldon
2987,can i look yet,Sheldon
2988,wowza,Sheldon
2989,what a gryffindor sleeping with a hufflepuff how scandalous you naughty girl you went to the wizarding world theme park without me,Sheldon
2990,yes you’re in trouble you went to wizarding world without me,Sheldon
2991,you know i’ve been wanting to go,Sheldon
2992,oh you’re right i’m sorry,Sheldon
2993,five minutes we must be doing it wrong it took us hours,Sheldon
2994,she’s right you know i just learned amy went to a theme park without me but i’m not going to ruin her birthday i’ll wait and ruin individual hours sprinkled throughout the year boop,Sheldon
2995,but if my mom asks we have bunk beds,Sheldon
2996,i was not thinking it although now that you point it out it is undeniable,Sheldon
2997,raj show some compassion those are things that we think but don’t say,Sheldon
2998,oh speaking of personal growth i recently tried eating swiss chard you know i didn’t swallow it but amy said it counted,Sheldon
2999,some will be successful some may be homeless it’s fun to think about,Sheldon
3000,it was bernadette had her baby i made it to wizarding world and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration hankius pankius,Sheldon
3001,amy i just saw a magic train and reported somebody for cutting the line if that’s not foreplay i don’t know what is,Sheldon
3002,oh actually i would,Sheldon
3003,let’s take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here,Sheldon
3004,you know i have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building,Sheldon
3005,you know i wonder how she feels about all this artwork,Sheldon
3006,it truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with penny,Sheldon
3007,yeah it seems only right that she have it back,Sheldon
3008,look it’s the same smile she has in the painting,Sheldon
3009,yeah there’s hooks in the closet i can hang it right now,Sheldon
3010,what happened to them,Sheldon
3011,you know leonard the more i think about it there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and i should go through uh for example who gets our beloved sword longclaw,Sheldon
3012,that seems fair we did just give you the painting,Sheldon
3013,wonderful longclaw is mine and how about you keep our avocado plant,Sheldon
3014,although amy and i did just move in together and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift,Sheldon
3015,oh we got a sword and a plant our apartment’s really shaping up,Sheldon
3016,oh remember when we got this at comiccon,Sheldon
3017,it’s one of a kind,Sheldon
3018,well leonard you know who should keep this on the one hand i love mr spock more than you do on the other hand i care more about clocks than you do,Sheldon
3019,i’ll be right across the hall you’ll probably be able to hear it,Sheldon
3020,thank you,Sheldon
3021,oh now what about our d chess set,Sheldon
3022,well no i just didn’t think you’d want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win as a kindness i should probably take all the games,Sheldon
3023,are you sure these items represent our shared times together,Sheldon
3024,for a man so good at predicting my moves how come you stink at d chess,Sheldon
3025,it’s not my fault i’m bad at sharing i skipped kindergarten,Sheldon
3026,yeah take whatever you want,Sheldon
3027,but you don’t even like flags,Sheldon
3028,but i designed it,Sheldon
3029,but you don’t even understand its symbolism,Sheldon
3030,come along amy i know when i’m not wanted,Sheldon
3031,well powder me in sugar and call me a doughnut if it isn’t leonard hofstadter,Sheldon
3032,if it’s like your d chess game then you’re out of your length width and depth amy get the neosporin somebody just got burned,Sheldon
3033,all right i tried that should be the title of your autobiography ooh a seconddegree burn,Sheldon
3034,it’s a good thing you’re cute,Sheldon
3035,what do you think you’re doing,Sheldon
3036,this is the level you’re stooping to,Sheldon
3037,so there are fresh linens on the bed and oh well now i see you’ve met theodore theodore these are your new room mates leonard and penny they’re very honest but i would not leave cash lying around,Sheldon
3038,my room is paid up until the end of the month so i can do with it whatever i please which includes renting it out for a dollar a night,Sheldon
3039,anyway i’ll leave you be i have to oh oh he’s expecting a newspaper in the morning apparently they still make them,Sheldon
3040,that’s true but had i done something under the line there wouldn’t be a man in your kitchen who can’t produce a single form of id,Sheldon
3041,and now you know as much about him as i do,Sheldon
3042,will you keep it down what kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think i’m running,Sheldon
3043,i’m being awful you’re the one who went out of your way to hurt me,Sheldon
3044,dividing our belongings is difficult,Sheldon
3045,i have to admit leaving you to move in with amy has been harder than i thought it would be,Sheldon
3046,leonard i would like us to stop fighting about our possessions,Sheldon
3047,in fact i want you to keep the apartment flag and i’m not just saying that because it touched your genitals,Sheldon
3048,i do and to show you that there are no hard feelings i am willing to rub my genitals on it as well,Sheldon
3049,why are you all smiling like crazy people,Sheldon
3050,cohabitation with my girlfriend that’s a great deal to process,Sheldon
3051,i don’t know what if living together kills the romance,Sheldon
3052,yeah but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain i mean she’s never even seen me unshaven,Sheldon
3053,don’t try luring me in with sexy talk,Sheldon
3054,if you want to lure me in with sexy talk that’s how you do it,Sheldon
3055,not yet how will i learn if i’m comfortable living with amy or just comfortable because i’m in my own apartment now if this experiment is going to be valid i suggest a neutral environment,Sheldon
3056,well ideally an enclosed selfsustaining biodome in new mexico where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste,Sheldon
3057,interesting if my official residence were across the hall i wonder if i’d need to knock every time i came over here,Sheldon
3058,historically i don’t do well with change,Sheldon
3059,you’re darn right you wouldn’t no matter where i am this will always be my spot like an embassy in a foreign country this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom,Sheldon
3060,very well i’m on board,Sheldon
3061,yes i accept this fiveweek mission to share a living space with my girlfriend,Sheldon
3062,well now don’t be surprised if like star trek it’s cancelled in three,Sheldon
3063,oh thank you,Sheldon
3064,of course the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical sheldons and amys one pair that was neither dating nor living together one pair that was dating but not living together one pair that was living together but not dating and then of course one pair that was living together and dating although with that many sheldons it’d be such a party we’d never get anything done,Sheldon
3065,well you’ve lived with your significant other for some time i would like this experiment to go well are there any insights you can share,Sheldon
3066,you know leonard and i were very happy before you came along,Sheldon
3067,how many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move,Sheldon
3068,you truly are the goofus to my gallant,Sheldon
3069,oh excited concerned a little scared all the same emotions i feel in line at space mountain,Sheldon
3070,okay talk,Sheldon
3071,wow no foreplay or anything just right to it,Sheldon
3072,you’re really okay with that,Sheldon
3073,this is such a relief honestly if it didn’t get you all worked up i’d kiss you right now,Sheldon
3074,i know they probably shouldn’t sell those to children,Sheldon
3075,enjoy having the place to yourselves,Sheldon
3076,it’s penny’s bedroom plenty of men have gone before,Sheldon
3077,i guess this is it,Sheldon
3078,you too oh don’t forget tuesday the air filters need to be changed,Sheldon
3079,oh oh and every other day check the water level on the avocado pit,Sheldon
3080,leonard please let me go,Sheldon
3081,oh bye,Sheldon
3082,i guess the experiment begins,Sheldon
3083,which side of the bed would you prefer,Sheldon
3084,no no we’re living together now everything’s equal you know i know that i have a tendency to be controlling so i would rather you choose,Sheldon
3085,well clearly it’s not whatever i want because what i want is for you to make this decision and you refuse to do that,Sheldon
3086,like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom and then watched me roll right into traffic,Sheldon
3087,fine okay now on this side i am closer to the exit in case of emergency,Sheldon
3088,no but i’m also closer to the entrance in case of attack,Sheldon
3089,ah then again what are the odds of someone attacking me,Sheldon
3090,now this side offers me proximity to the bathroom but i am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep,Sheldon
3091,i suppose that works,Sheldon
3092,although now i’m kind of worried someone’s hiding behind those drapes,Sheldon
3093,be grateful i’m still in the room,Sheldon
3094,oh i’m just happy i don’t know what this memory foam remembers,Sheldon
3095,well it’s funny you should ask because i was wondering how you’d feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall,Sheldon
3096,okay well i am sorry i’m just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night and no offence but your bottom radiates enough heat i’m surprised there aren’t iguanas lying on it,Sheldon
3097,no dr feynman if i solve it for you you’ll never learn,Sheldon
3098,what are you doing down there,Sheldon
3099,who are you calling aaargh,Sheldon
3100,good morning see i didn’t knock but it’s fine i didn’t knock but it’s fine i didn’t knock but it’s fine so how is everyone,Sheldon
3101,really i slept great,Sheldon
3102,how you had the whole floor to yourself,Sheldon
3103,well but what kind of scientists would we be drawing a conclusion after only hours of data,Sheldon
3104,wow i anticipated we’d have problems but i never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them,Sheldon
3105,if the lab room disposable shoe cover fits,Sheldon
3106,how dare you,Sheldon
3107,whoa whoa now you’re making fun of my bona fides,Sheldon
3108,well if you are so protective of the scientific method perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started,Sheldon
3109,for science maybe you should,Sheldon
3110,fine,Sheldon
3111,great,Sheldon
3112,does stephen hawking roll through the quad,Sheldon
3113,hello,Sheldon
3114,oh you know the lone star state hmm that should be its yelp rating,Sheldon
3115,yeah it is good to be home oh good lord is that mistletoe don’t you maniacs own a calendar,Sheldon
3116,it was fine other than the weirdtasting juice amy gave me i slept the whole way,Sheldon
3117,well we were on our way to my mother’s house…,Sheldon

3438,he’s not wrong it was your crackpot idea that he deserves love,Sheldon
3439,you and leonard don’t have anything in common maybe you should break up,Sheldon
3440,actually our friendship group is at capacity but if anybody drops out you’re at the top of the list unless it’s raj in which case we’ll probably get a person of colour,Sheldon
3441,so he’s using his money to attract a mate is that any different than me using my intelligence to attract amy or leonard using his power of grovelling to get penny,Sheldon
3442,oh so many things her mind her kindness and especially her body,Sheldon
3443,hello i’m dr sheldon cooper,Sheldon

3446,everything is stupid and i want to go home,Sheldon
3447,hey it’s not even called the genius grant it’s the macarthur fellowship just like it’s not frankenstein it’s frankenstein’s monster which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there and if anyone’s a genius it’s me for the way i brought that full circle,Sheldon
3448,oh good maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under,Sheldon

3469,yeah but you’ve got all those things and no one’s lining up to be you,Sheldon
3470,uh do you really think calling me names is helpful,Sheldon
3471,maybe you’re right,Sheldon
3472,thank you penny you know i just need to keep reminding myself that bert’s success is not my failure,Sheldon
3473,and that men of his large stature are more susceptible to a wide array of lifethreatening diseases,Sheldon
3474,top of the afternoon gentlemen,Sheldon
3475,well it’s a new day i have a new outlook you know i realized i don’t need to worry about other people i just need to think more about myself,Sheldon
3476,bert did quality research and he deserves whatever accolades he receives,Sheldon
3477,excuse me i need to pay bert a proper congratulations,Sheldon
3478,bert i wanted to let you know that i read your research and your award is welldeserved,Sheldon
3479,well just this once you can count me as people too,Sheldon

3511,oh just let me look oh my goodness i see quivering black lines those must be neurons oh they’re so thick and beautiful,Sheldon
3512,i have such a profound sense of creation i it’s like when i hatched sea monkeys except that this is from my dna so this is like me monkeys,Sheldon
3513,yeah but us monkeys doesn’t pop oh oh oh oh wait we monkeys there you go hey when can we start running tests on it,Sheldon
3514,what stimulus should we introduce it to first light sound temperature oh oh let’s,Sheldon
3515,i understand she’s the mean one i’m the fun one,Sheldon
3516,look look here i am standing next to the incubator uh here is a microscopic view of the cells,Sheldon
3517,aw yeah this little guy can already recognize electronically transmitted images faster than any other sample in amy’s lab,Sheldon
3518,yeah i have to say it is nice to share this experience with someone who’s on the same journey although right now ours is testing off the charts while yours is floating around in its own waste,Sheldon
3519,well i didn’t make you waddle up four flights of stairs for the heck of it,Sheldon
3520,yeah but ours can recognize a specific data stream among background noise,Sheldon
3521,ours doesn’t need an immune system because it lives in a stateoftheart german incubator,Sheldon
3522,okay fine let’s just agree that both creations are special in their own way and it is foolish to try and compare them although we didn’t need to have sex with howard for ours so we win,Sheldon
3523,would you look at that the image we gave it was white noise and it still managed to reconstruct it,Sheldon
3524,yeah we need to stop for magnets on the way home this is going right on the fridge,Sheldon
3525,oh i am and you realize what the next step is,Sheldon
3526,uh no we lock that door lower our underpants a little and make a baby,Sheldon
3527,clearly the combination of our dna is exceptional our child could be the next step in the evolution of mankind we’ll be able to get into any preschool we want,Sheldon
3528,oh yes you are i track your cycle for the next hours you’re as fertile as a manurecovered wheat field,Sheldon
3529,i don’t understand i thought you’d be thrilled to procreate with me,Sheldon

3539,you guys are aroused right,Sheldon
3540,hello,Sheldon
3541,because i am,Sheldon
3542,i have a plan to work on both projects simultaneously and for your information the summer conference on algebraic topology at caltech is nerd prom,Sheldon
3543,well i’m not needed at both places at the same time and i can also free up extra hours with simple tricks such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point,Sheldon
3544,soon see i could’ve said in the near future but i didn’t say in the near future because in the near future is three more words than soon in one the two near three future four see in the near future is four soon is just one four is more than one saving time already,Sheldon
3545,gentlemen i’ve got amy up and running shall we get to work,Sheldon
3546,these are hydration backpacks for efficiency whenever i’m thirsty i have access to water when i’m hungry i have lentil soup,Sheldon

3548,oh sorry uh carrot chunk,Sheldon
3549,ah i’m back you got me for eight minutes,Sheldon
3550,the coefficient isn’t lambda it’s lambda sub one and over here you should consider the possibility that the brain itself is in two different quantum states and lastly do you have any little soup crackers,Sheldon
3551,it’s five and a half,Sheldon
3552,brb that’s short for be right back i’m saving so much time,Sheldon
3553,the two signals meet up in the corpus callosum and t equals zero and i know a boy who just earned a slurp of soup,Sheldon
3554,you know i felt the same way about the spork uh solids and liquids handled by one utensil that’ll never work spoiler works,Sheldon
3555,yeah i felt the same way about the platypus you know bird and mammal in the same creature no way and spoiler way,Sheldon

3599,i know our apartment’s small but i think we can make room,Sheldon
3600,wow i’m starting to think you didn’t mean it when you said you wanted to spruce up the place,Sheldon
3601,hi uh penny this circular is addressed to occupant but with our apartment switch it’s unclear whether it’s yours or mine,Sheldon
3602,roofing,Sheldon
3603,okay thanks just throw it out speaking of occupants i’m given to understand raj will be moving into my old room,Sheldon
3604,what about his dog,Sheldon
3605,i suppose that’s acceptable,Sheldon
3606,if real dogs gave me buttons i’d like them too well i think it’s very nice that you’re helping out our friend,Sheldon
3607,and what is that supposed to mean,Sheldon
3608,if you’re implying that i’d have some problem with him moving into my room you’re wrong raj is in a difficult financial situation and i’m glad that he’s making changes to improve it,Sheldon
3609,i mean it’s unfair people just assume i’m going to be upset by raj moving into my old room,Sheldon
3610,oh i’m outraged,Sheldon
3611,well that’s been my room since before i met leonard and now someone else is going to be living in it and that someone else is not me and you know how i feel about people who aren’t me,Sheldon
3612,wrong we were standing outside my room in the hallway,Sheldon
3613,i realize it’s irrational but with raj moving in there i’m feeling a bit replaced,Sheldon
3614,yes probably but until we know for sure how can i feel better,Sheldon
3615,all set,Sheldon
3616,a housewarming gift for raj,Sheldon
3617,it’s nothing like that i just i thought about raj’s situation and i had a change of heart you know and regarding your gift you said surprise me and boy did i hello,Sheldon
3618,uh wait before we eat i have a little welcome to the building gift for raj,Sheldon
3619,well i had some of my best ideas in that room and i’m sure you will too,Sheldon
3620,well i know this is a difficult time for you you’re losing your apartment you’re in debt and you just you must be humiliated,Sheldon
3621,oh good grief she is such a stickler for citing sources those were amy’s words,Sheldon
3622,i know i know good grief was originally said by charlie brown geez,Sheldon
3623,can you believe this guy,Sheldon
3624,i thought that was gonna break the other way,Sheldon
3625,fine you took my room you turned my friends against me i hope you’re happy,Sheldon
3626,how come he can say it and i can’t,Sheldon
3627,honestly i’ve been better do you have time leonard says you’re very busy these days,Sheldon
3628,well our friend raj moved into my old room and it’s brought up a lot of negative feelings for me,Sheldon
3629,beverley you know i hold you in high esteem can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer and get to the part where you tell me the answer,Sheldon
3630,i have,Sheldon
3631,i hadn’t thought about that,Sheldon
3632,i had no idea all our relationships were such a disaster boy you’re good,Sheldon
3633,hey raj i owe you an apology look could you please put your dog on a leash,Sheldon
3634,well then at least hold her still so i can pretend she’s stuffed raj i let my emotions get the best of me and i unfairly took it out on you,Sheldon
3635,no i can’t take all the credit i spoke with leonard’s mother and she made me feel better,Sheldon
3636,beverly pointed out that i’m experiencing insecurities in my relationship with amy in the same way that leonard and penny are in their relationship,Sheldon
3637,yes you’re fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems it used to be me now it’s raj and his attack tribble anyway i’m sorry for everything oh and fyi if you cry while they’re fighting they’ll take you to mcdonald’s,Sheldon
3638,i can’t sleep,Sheldon
3639,beverley believes i unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch,Sheldon
3640,yes i don’t care for unconscious thoughts my brain and i are best friends it should tell me everything,Sheldon
3641,what if she’s correct doesn’t that say something troubling about us,Sheldon
3642,that is true did you know i figured out in which order i would eat all my friends in the event of an apocalypse,Sheldon
3643,penny would be the entree then leonard’s basically a cheese course and because i love you you’re dessert,Sheldon
3644,amy quick lock the door,Sheldon
3645,you know what i’m proud of us yeah with penny and leonard taking in raj and stuart living with howard and bernadette we’re the only couple of our social group who doesn’t need to fill the holes in their relationship with a third party,Sheldon
3646,how are you settling in,Sheldon
3647,now i’ve learned some fun facts about new jersey to help you make small talk would you like to know the state bird or the murder rate they’re both shocking,Sheldon
3648,well i’m a lot less likely to see an eastern goldfinch or be murdered i’ll tell you that,Sheldon
3649,i miss you too,Sheldon
3650,i’m sorry you had to go through that,Sheldon
3651,you know you just split an infinitive,Sheldon
3652,i am it is naughty to put an adverb between the word to and the verb stem,Sheldon
3653,i’m going to admonish you,Sheldon
3654,that’s the only kind of admonishing i do,Sheldon
3655,gentlemen you may remember dr nowitzki she’s back at caltech for her postdoc,Sheldon
3656,oh thanks dr nowitzki’s going to tell me about the work she did at cern and she brought me this dutyfree toblerone,Sheldon
3657,let’s sit somewhere else,Sheldon
3658,so tell me about your scalar dark energy experiment,Sheldon
3659,oh you must be one of those dessert before dinner people,Sheldon
3660,and get this i saw an articulating ladder with dualleg leveling which delivers stability and adaptability to uneven terrain,Sheldon
3661,yeah raj made the funniest joke he said which is the best ladder to use to hang myself,Sheldon
3662,oh not at all i’ve had outings with leonard and raj in the evening and oh i had lunch,Sheldon
3663,oh dr nowitzki is a woman,Sheldon
3664,many years ago back when she was a grad student she’s always been a huge fan of my work and now she’s doing research at caltech,Sheldon
3665,yes i think you’d like her she’s extremely intelligent just like you unlike you she’s tall blonde and used to be an olympic swimmer,Sheldon
3666,hey everybody this is my friend dr nowitzki,Sheldon
3667,we just went swimming,Sheldon
3668,i was scared but i told myself it’s just a big bathtub then i got scared again ’cause there are all these strangers in my bathtub,Sheldon
3669,well i was hiding from a bee but it still counts,Sheldon
3670,yes we skyped this morning and i’m sure i’ll check in with her before i go to sleep,Sheldon
3671,that is true she keeps asking how long amy’s going to be gone,Sheldon
3672,leonard your wife is sitting right here what are you doing,Sheldon
3673,she was part of the american team at cern,Sheldon
3674,do you know i’ve corresponded with peter higgs would you like to see some of his letters,Sheldon
3675,i’ll get them,Sheldon
3676,oh fun like a play date,Sheldon
3677,here you go,Sheldon
3678,hmm oh no no no they’re from many famous people see oh like this one this is from patrick stewart it says if i come to his house again i get to meet his dogs oh excuse me,Sheldon
3679,oh hello amy,Sheldon
3680,i miss you too hey this is good timing remember that dr nowitzki i told you about she’s right here,Sheldon
3681,what is leonard doing calling you at this hour,Sheldon
3682,i must tell you that seems a little inappropriate don’t you agree,Sheldon
3683,see we both think so,Sheldon
3684,hey i hate to break up the party but amy says i’m tired and have to go to bed,Sheldon
3685,of course,Sheldon
3686,that was fun it was like mario kart,Sheldon
3687,bye,Sheldon
3688,what is this about leonard and amy i don’t like it either,Sheldon
3689,that doesn’t make any sense she knows i have a girlfriend,Sheldon
3690,that may be true but dr nowitzki’s just a friend in fact i wouldn’t have even noticed she’s a woman if she hadn’t worn that bathing suit that highlighted her bosom,Sheldon
3691,i already do,Sheldon
3692,because there’s only one of me i’m more valuable,Sheldon
3693,although amy’s already taken me out of my package and played with me,Sheldon
3694,penny look i appreciate your concern but i don’t think that’s what’s happening,Sheldon
3695,i think dr nowitzki is a friendly colleague i think you and leonard need to see a marriage counsellor and i need to update my résumé to include swimming as a special skill,Sheldon
3696,uh breakfast yes lunch no i did have a cough drop but that really rides the line between sucking and eating,Sheldon
3697,how thoughtful thank you,Sheldon
3698,and i with you question are you seeking a romantic relationship with me,Sheldon
3699,well that would raise a number of problems we’re colleagues i’m currently in a relation… excuse me a moment,Sheldon
3700,knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy will you marry me,Sheldon
3701,things have been going really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope,Sheldon
3702,oh the project is classified i can’t tell you oh i suppose i could redact the classified parts all right um i came up with an elegant solution to the honks horn i used the honks horn and then i honks horn and that did it car passes honking horn wow i wonder what they’re redacting,Sheldon
3703,oh very well what have you been working on and feel free to honk during the boring parts,Sheldon
3704,so you’re attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain,Sheldon
3705,well what do you know here i was waiting to be bored with biology and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy which unlike my body is an okay place to tickle,Sheldon
3706,gentlemen the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon,Sheldon
3707,yeah i picked it up without thinking about it which raises a neuroscientific question when did i decide to pick it up,Sheldon
3708,amy is studying the time lag between intent and awareness and i realized that applies to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics now i recognize there will be a time lag between me saying that and you googling what it means so i’ll wait,Sheldon
3709,well don’t get me wrong neurobiology’s nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff but you know when it connects to physics gas up the ford martha we’re going for a drive,Sheldon
3710,i was thinking about your experiment on the neuroscience of decision making and i realized if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness in the copenhagen interpretation,Sheldon
3711,it could be the most inspired combination since i mixed red icee into my blue icee it was like drinking two sevenths of the rainbow,Sheldon
3712,yeah and this one won’t stain my teeth purple,Sheldon
3713,that is a valid point perhaps we should establish some ground rules,Sheldon
3714,all right let’s start right now uh rule number one no using sexuality to get your way,Sheldon
3715,is it,Sheldon
3716,i believe i’ve made some progress on our ground rules,Sheldon
3717,okay uh number one in matters of physics i have the final say in matters of neuroscience you have the final say unless i disagree oh here number two when we publish,Sheldon
3718,oh of course i’ll get that back like all my underwear that notebook says property of sheldon cooper,Sheldon
3719,i’d write that down but i can’t now can i,Sheldon
3720,thank you you are a good citizen told you go ahead throw my underwear out the window same thing’s gonna happen,Sheldon
3721,fire away,Sheldon
3722,that’s smart because sheldon amy,Sheldon
3723,aw someone drew a penis in it,Sheldon
3724,i’m sorry go ahead,Sheldon
3725,ooh that sounds fun now we’re talking about real treats right not bible verses like my mother used to give me,Sheldon
3726,biology and physics coming together this is like the peanut butter cup of the mind oh i know what i want my treat to be,Sheldon
3727,yes this is remarkable,Sheldon
3728,by the way your name can go first,Sheldon
3729,yeah the math is so inelegant i’m not even sure it makes sense,Sheldon
3730,can you stop breathing so loud i can hear your nose whistling,Sheldon
3731,all right either blow your nose or teach it to play camptown races,Sheldon
3732,no i can still hear it oh wait that’s me never mind it’s fine,Sheldon
3733,hold on i see what’s wrong here we did the propagation only to the occipital lobe not to the prefrontal cortex,Sheldon
3734,oh that is much better yeah boy if good ideas came out of your brain the way mucus comes out of your nose we’d be in good shape,Sheldon

4390,i cannot believe leonard mentioned the toblerone but left that part out,Penny
4391,i don’t know we shouldn’t worry her if it’s nothing,Penny
4392,yeah do you think living with amy has somehow stirred up sheldon’s sexual appetite,Penny
4393,all right then we agree he’s not making any moves it’s this dr ramona chick,Penny
4394,really all i got from leonard was the toblerone bar had nuts,Penny
4395,oh hey amy,Penny
4396,we thought you meant not letting him run out into traffic,Penny

4401,do you really think there’s reason to worry,Penny

4414,well sometimes women don’t care sometimes it makes them want a guy even more,Penny
4415,okay um let’s try this think of yourself as one of those limited edition toys people like to collect,Penny
4416,well then you get it,Penny

5091,i don’t know we shouldn’t worry her if it’s nothing,Penny
5092,yeah do you think living with amy has somehow stirred up sheldon’s sexual appetite,Penny
5093,all right then we agree he’s not making any moves it’s this dr ramona chick,Penny
5094,really all i got from leonard was the toblerone bar had nuts,Penny

5207,oh yeah how do you think i stay this thin,Howard
5208,sheldon we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years,Howard
5209,you know maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer,Howard
5210,why because i’m jewish that’s like me saying hey you’re indian doesn’t your cousin work in a call centre,Howard
5211,and my cousin’s a lawyer,Howard
5212,give me a second to call my cousin,Howard
5213,first of all he’s in boca raton which is better than fort lauderdale but more importantly he lasted two days on jeopardy so he’s clearly a smart guy,Howard
5214,hey marty thanks for talking to us,Howard
5215,well i married a little catholic girl so we’re even anyway this is leonard and sheldon the three of us came up with the guidance system,Howard
5216,and this is my friend raj,Howard

5218,marty let me call you back,Howard
5219,no,Howard
5220,hello,Howard
5221,it’s a group effort but i guess if we had to pick a main brain it would be me,Howard
5222,really you’re a physicist,Howard
5223,oh well hey me too,Howard
5224,well thanks but you should know we’re a little concerned about this being used in weapons,Howard
5225,i’m not even sure that’s possible,Howard
5226,four months,Howard
5227,well maybe i don’t know we’ll have to work hours a day seven days a week,Howard
5228,i love your french toast,Howard
5229,we didn’t sheldon did,Howard
5230,no but mostly there was an awkward pause and i broke it by saying okay,Howard
5231,would you stop we’re just gonna be on the other side of campus,Howard
5232,you are a deeply silly man,Howard
5233,maybe that’s because it’s classified,Howard
5234,i guess this is it,Howard
5235,let’s find out,Howard
5236,oh oh oh oh guys hold me upside down,Howard
5237,go come on raj,Howard
5238,we’re betting to see if koothrappali can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin,Howard
5239,yeah we’re seeing if raj can hold his breath longer than it,Howard
5240,yes he is,Howard
5241,ha you’re interested you’re out ten bucks,Howard
5242,come on raj it’s like your favourite movie you’re just waiting to exhale yeah i knew you could do it,Howard

5245,maybe your dad’s right,Howard
5246,you don’t need your dad’s money you can get by on your salary,Howard
5247,well how much do you spend on food,Howard
5248,what what are you doing i i i schlepped the baby over i brought imported beer why don’t you like me,Howard
5249,we are that’s why i’m sad my best friend’s gonna be homeless,Howard
5250,wait why are we talking about our place when sheldon’s old room is sitting there perfectly empty,Howard
5251,oh how’s the dog gonna go to the bathroom,Howard
5252,that’s understandable,Howard
5253,i thought things were going well what happened,Howard
5254,sometimes people say things they don’t mean,Howard
5255,because that’s not what people do,Howard
5256,you if it’s at mit i can make some calls maybe we can get sheldon a prototype,Howard
5257,sheldon i just heard from the guys at mit about that emotion reader they’re sending a prototype for you to beta test,Howard
5258,well you don’t need a machine for that just send a survey card to all your exgirlfriends and tell them if they fill it out they might win a prize,Howard
5259,yeah i was joking,Howard
5260,this thing’s pretty cool it interprets emotions using a wireless signal to analyse subtle changes in breathing and heart rate,Howard
5261,the display is synced to your phone give it a try,Howard
5262,okay remember it can only detect happy sad angry and excited not other things you’re feeling like what have i done with my life,Howard
5263,try another one,Howard
5264,oh god you went through with that what is wrong with you,Howard
5265,you’re so stupid,Howard
5266,no he doesn’t think it’s stupid,Howard

5272,sorry is that gary with one r or two,Howard
5273,oh wow don’t let him get away,Howard
5274,uh basically she traded you for bruce wayne,Howard
5275,wait hang on i just want to point out to everyone here this is a man who is going to great lengths to better himself even at the risk of being humiliated and i for one think that’s very brave,Howard
5276,well like you gals i had to suffer through him to find bernadette,Howard
5277,thanks ladies this was fun let’s not wait so long for another bizarre awkward night,Howard
5278,don’t beat yourself up that’s what i’m here for,Howard

5291,well my wife is fourfootten and sexually satisfied so clearly i know my way around tiny things,Howard
5292,those are just the things i say out loud,Howard
5293,what’s wrong,Howard
5294,yeah it doesn’t need to be smaller,Howard
5295,sheldon we don’t need to make this smaller and your work is done go home,Howard

5297,i don’t care if we’re in a drought it’s worth it,Howard
5298,we can just lock the door you don’t have to kill him,Howard
5299,it’s so peaceful without him here can i ask you how much that cost,Howard
5300,great we found a cooling solution that allowed us to get the size of the prototype down to the target specs,Howard
5301,but we’ve already met the agreed upon specs going smaller would require weeks’ worth of new computations,Howard
5302,okay but that’s just a theory it’s not even a complete thought,Howard
5303,the kid with the two shirts screwed us again,Howard
5304,i can’t believe we have to ask sheldon to come back and help us,Howard
5305,i don’t know but if he yells it’s alive we run,Howard
5306,how’d you even get that up the stairs,Howard

5315,it’s a manifold,Howard
5316,told ya can you fix it for us,Howard
5317,but if you really want to learn the mechanical side i can teach you anything you want to know,Howard
5318,and with all these new skills you’d be able to fix any model train you’d be the king of the train store,Howard
5319,that’s a turbo,Howard
5320,maybe to you you didn’t get a traffic ticket,Howard
5321,hey if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic then yeah okay,Howard

5455,you’re gonna love it,Howard
5456,okay well i may have gone a bit overboard but you can’t put a price on safety,Howard

5458,in our new minivan hey what’s for lunch,Howard
5459,it’s for the baby and i didn’t buy it the dealer loaned it to me for a hour test drive,Howard
5460,the guy at the dealership said they’re not just for moms anymore,Howard
5461,it’s got a rearview camera there’s a dvd player oh and check this out it’s like we’re living in the future,Howard
5462,imagine this you’ve got the baby in one hand groceries in the other and you’re thinking how am i gonna open this trunk,Howard
5463,you don’t need my help when you can open the trunk with a simple kick of the foot,Howard
5464,uh maybe it was more of a circle,Howard
5465,yes,Howard
5466,see easy and look at all this cargo space now we’ll get the crib out and you can take it for a testdrive i’m telling you this van is gonna be… uuhuuh uuhuuh,Howard

5468,aaaaah what was i thinking wolowitzes are not a lifting people we tip the lifting people,Howard
5469,you’re gonna feel terrible when i’m in a wheelchair which by the way would fit easily in the back of this awardwinning minivan,Howard
5470,you’re right it sells itself,Howard
5471,if childbirth is half this bad you are so screwed are we there yet,Howard
5472,why is it taking so long,Howard
5473,i’m in too much pain to watch cartoo… oh this is a good one,Howard

5475,oh say can you see it’s fun with flags,Howard
5476,oh right drumroll,Howard
5477,aw you think you have an audience that’s funny,Howard

5479,oh well just out of curiosity what registers as odd to you,Howard
5480,you heard him guys don’t ask,Howard
5481,and how single are you right now,Howard
5482,don’t do that you’ve got gold here hang onto it until you’re in trouble and then throw it in her face,Howard
5483,so you wouldn’t want to have anything on penny,Howard
5484,so if i actually know something right now and i do you don’t want me to tell you,Howard
5485,i’ll take that as a yes she’s secretly been moving your collectibles into storage a little at a time and you haven’t noticed,Howard
5486,see i’ve known that for weeks but you know i waited till the moment when it would cause him the most pain,Howard
5487,it just came up because we we were talking about secrets and… wait juh qachhom dotlh sov ‘iv who knows the status of amy’s apartment,Howard
5488,you’re up blabby,Howard
5489,you know if he moves across the hall for good leonard could keep the stuff you don’t like in sheldon’s old room solves everything,Howard
5490,okay last question the chaps he was wearing assless,Howard
5491,this isn’t complicated do you love amy,Howard
5492,all right got halley to sleep,Howard
5493,yeah got to get her hooked on tv or someday she’ll want me to play outside boy that floor is so squeaky i’m surprised i didn’t wake her up walking out of the room,Howard
5494,well i put the rug down it didn’t help,Howard
5495,did try nailing a couple of the boards down,Howard
5496,yeah it left little holes in the floor that’s why i bought the rug,Howard
5497,that sounds expensive,Howard
5498,mit’s motto is mind and hand which just so happens was also my motto as a lonely teenager,Howard
5499,no,Howard
5500,no,Howard
5501,is that supposed to be funny,Howard
5502,okay this grid represents the room all we need to do is plot out where each squeak is and we can find a quiet path to the crib,Howard
5503,mm except the creature in the crib is a levelnine poop monster,Howard
5504,okay space a here we go it’s squeaking mark it,Howard
5505,mm i hope she has the same amount of sex in it i did none next square,Howard
5506,it’s a tradition of my people singing if i were a rich man ya ba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dum,Howard
5507,so what we did was map out the entire room to identify every squeak watch it’s easy,Howard
5508,then simply sit spin stand stretch maybe in looser pants then step grab tiny pivot pull and you’re there easy peasy mac and… you get the idea,Howard
5509,bigger problems i felt something pop,Howard
5510,we can’t get through,Howard
5511,then use the shoot button not the wonderful thing about tiggers button,Howard
5512,okay challenge them again,Howard
5513,no wonder they beat us they’re jocks,Howard

5519,okay well how about oh i teach you some closeup magic,Howard
5520,hey the circus arts are very physically and mentally demanding have you ever tried to juggle,Howard
5521,and it’s hard isn’t it so the key is the moment one ball is at the top of its arc you toss the next one hmm,Howard
5522,uh hold on there’s an old saying in juggling,Howard
5523,no it’s if you want to have fun start with one yours we think but we do not say all right just toss it up and catch it a few times get comfortable with it,Howard
5524,no,Howard
5525,so you told her she was being dumb,Howard
5526,i don’t know maybe,Howard

5530,i went to see your mom,Howard
5531,i just told you your mom’s,Howard
5532,well since you find my magic tricks so embarrassing i got to wondering what cool hobbies you had as a kid,Howard
5533,she didn’t say much of anything but she said a lot through ventriloquist’s doll hi bernadette remember me,Howard
5534,i can’t believe you made fun of me all these years while you were a closeted ventriloquist,Howard

5536,which is,Howard
5537,tammy jo st cloud oh and i’m a dork for juggling,Howard
5538,all right very funny,Howard
5539,that’s enough put her away,Howard

5542,what the hell,Howard
5543,but the movie did just get good,Howard
5544,but why would you do that,Howard
5545,this is all very upsetting,Howard

5547,although if anyone’s gonna clean out your apartment and disappear it’d be penny,Howard
5548,they wouldn’t say,Howard

5741,sure this is for you,Howard
5742,there’s more than enough in there to cover comiccon,Howard
5743,you know what i’m not gonna go either i’m a father now i’d rather spend time with my family,Howard
5744,i’m gonna go check on dinner,Howard
5745,it’s pretty late you think i’ve got time to run some more simulations on the cooling system,Howard
5746,what,Howard
5747,hey hey hey you’re not going anywhere,Howard
5748,well wake up we’re gonna put in a lot of late nights,Howard
5749,well i don’t know midnight one,Howard
5750,if you’re tired have some coffee,Howard
5751,i am having coffee,Howard
5752,sorry i have to work all weekend,Howard
5753,thanks again for breakfast,Howard
5754,why is it taking him so long to get a drink out of a vending machine,Howard
5755,you wanted him awake,Howard
5756,maybe we should break for lunch what time is it,Howard
5757,why don’t you just go home,Howard
5758,you can’t develop a problem that fast,Howard
5759,well this probably won’t work but has anyone ever tried to just haul off and whup the crazy out of him,Howard
5760,no worries,Howard
5761,that was painful to watch,Howard
5762,no,Howard
5763,when the baby gets here you gotta teach me that,Howard
5764,we’ve hit a bit of a snag we’re already behind schedule,Howard
5765,we we’re thinking two years,Howard
5766,that’s it you’re okay with that,Howard
5767,yes thank you so much,Howard
5768,wanna see a movie,Howard
5769,all right we got a problem,Howard
5770,the air force contacted me about our quantum gyroscope they want to have a meeting,Howard
5771,and if that happens we’ll never be able to sell it commercially,Howard
5772,i was counting on that money i need to make as much as my wife so i don’t have to try so hard in bed,Howard
5773,oh yeah how do you think i stay this thin,Howard
5774,sheldon we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years,Howard
5775,you know maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer,Howard
5776,why because i’m jewish that’s like me saying hey you’re indian doesn’t your cousin work in a call centre,Howard
5777,and my cousin’s a lawyer,Howard
5778,give me a second to call my cousin,Howard
5779,first of all he’s in boca raton which is better than fort lauderdale but more importantly he lasted two days on jeopardy so he’s clearly a smart guy,Howard
5780,hey marty thanks for talking to us,Howard
5781,well i married a little catholic girl so we’re even anyway this is leonard and sheldon the three of us came up with the guidance system,Howard
5782,and this is my friend raj,Howard
5783,anyway like i said in the email this meeting’s on thursday do you have any advice for us,Howard
5784,marty let me call you back,Howard
5785,no,Howard
5786,hello,Howard
5787,it’s a group effort but i guess if we had to pick a main brain it would be me,Howard
5788,really you’re a physicist,Howard
5789,oh well hey me too,Howard
5790,well thanks but you should know we’re a little concerned about this being used in weapons,Howard
5791,i’m not even sure that’s possible,Howard
5792,four months,Howard
5793,well maybe i don’t know we’ll have to work hours a day seven days a week,Howard
5794,i love your french toast,Howard
5795,we didn’t sheldon did,Howard
5796,no but mostly there was an awkward pause and i broke it by saying okay,Howard
5797,would you stop we’re just gonna be on the other side of campus,Howard
5798,you are a deeply silly man,Howard
5799,maybe that’s because it’s classified,Howard
5800,i guess this is it,Howard
5801,let’s find out,Howard
5802,oh oh oh oh guys hold me upside down,Howard
5803,go come on raj,Howard
5804,we’re betting to see if koothrappali can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin,Howard
5805,yeah we’re seeing if raj can hold his breath longer than it,Howard
5806,yes he is,Howard
5807,ha you’re interested you’re out ten bucks,Howard
5808,come on raj it’s like your favourite movie you’re just waiting to exhale yeah i knew you could do it,Howard
5809,and the car ride puts her to sleep,Howard
5810,oh no now we have two,Howard
5811,maybe your dad’s right,Howard
5812,you don’t need your dad’s money you can get by on your salary,Howard
5813,well how much do you spend on food,Howard
5814,what what are you doing i i i schlepped the baby over i brought imported beer why don’t you like me,Howard
5815,we are that’s why i’m sad my best friend’s gonna be homeless,Howard
5816,wait why are we talking about our place when sheldon’s old room is sitting there perfectly empty,Howard
5817,oh how’s the dog gonna go to the bathroom,Howard
5818,that’s understandable,Howard
5819,i thought things were going well what happened,Howard
5820,sometimes people say things they don’t mean,Howard
5821,because that’s not what people do,Howard
5822,you if it’s at mit i can make some calls maybe we can get sheldon a prototype,Howard
5823,sheldon i just heard from the guys at mit about that emotion reader they’re sending a prototype for you to beta test,Howard
5824,well you don’t need a machine for that just send a survey card to all your exgirlfriends and tell them if they fill it out they might win a prize,Howard
5825,yeah i was joking,Howard
5826,this thing’s pretty cool it interprets emotions using a wireless signal to analyse subtle changes in breathing and heart rate,Howard
5827,the display is synced to your phone give it a try,Howard
5828,okay remember it can only detect happy sad angry and excited not other things you’re feeling like what have i done with my life,Howard
5829,try another one,Howard
5830,oh god you went through with that what is wrong with you,Howard
5831,you’re so stupid,Howard
5832,no he doesn’t think it’s stupid,Howard
5833,hey you went out with him i didn’t,Howard
5834,like this one,Howard
5835,schmuck got it,Howard
5836,not a chance so you were telling us how raj was terrible in bed,Howard
5837,i thought you were great but oh my god you were so dominated by your parents,Howard
5838,sorry is that gary with one r or two,Howard
5839,oh wow don’t let him get away,Howard
5840,uh basically she traded you for bruce wayne,Howard
5841,wait hang on i just want to point out to everyone here this is a man who is going to great lengths to better himself even at the risk of being humiliated and i for one think that’s very brave,Howard
5842,well like you gals i had to suffer through him to find bernadette,Howard
5843,thanks ladies this was fun let’s not wait so long for another bizarre awkward night,Howard
5844,don’t beat yourself up that’s what i’m here for,Howard
5845,yeah the field was just here the field said no,Howard
5846,okay i’ll tell you what i’ll make you a deal years from now if you’re still single and things don’t work out with me and bernadette you and i can give it a go,Howard
5847,too late stuart called dibs,Howard
5848,i don’t know what difference does it make,Howard
5849,those do look fun,Howard
5850,if you didn’t want me to eat it why’d you put it out,Howard
5851,i’m not gonna get fat,Howard
5852,fine look i’ll exercise right now one two these are crunches by the way,Howard
5853,okay how about if i eat like this,Howard
5854,hey is that any way to talk to your future husband,Howard
5855,please when you see the ring i pick out you’re gonna melt,Howard
5856,okay i’m zeroing out the electroosmotic flow rate in the microfluidic channel,Howard
5857,well my wife is fourfootten and sexually satisfied so clearly i know my way around tiny things,Howard
5858,those are just the things i say out loud,Howard
5859,what’s wrong,Howard
5860,yeah it doesn’t need to be smaller,Howard
5861,sheldon we don’t need to make this smaller and your work is done go home,Howard
5862,i know that’s why i keep refilling his water when he’s not looking,Howard
5863,i don’t care if we’re in a drought it’s worth it,Howard
5864,we can just lock the door you don’t have to kill him,Howard
5865,it’s so peaceful without him here can i ask you how much that cost,Howard
5866,great we found a cooling solution that allowed us to get the size of the prototype down to the target specs,Howard
5867,but we’ve already met the agreed upon specs going smaller would require weeks’ worth of new computations,Howard
5868,okay but that’s just a theory it’s not even a complete thought,Howard
5869,the kid with the two shirts screwed us again,Howard
5870,i can’t believe we have to ask sheldon to come back and help us,Howard
5871,i don’t know but if he yells it’s alive we run,Howard
5872,how’d you even get that up the stairs,Howard
5873,open a window it’s about to get smug in here,Howard
5874,he’s worried about looking foolish that’s a heapin’ helping of irony right there,Howard
5875,all right hmm feel free to jump in hmm is all i got,Howard
5876,maybe we can find another theoretical physicist to help us,Howard
5877,hey i came up with that and hmm you haven’t pitched anything,Howard
5878,you really figured it out,Howard
5879,oh you’re a genius,Howard
5880,that’s right we figured it out all by ourselves wasn’t even that hard,Howard
5881,it’s a manifold,Howard
5882,told ya can you fix it for us,Howard
5883,but if you really want to learn the mechanical side i can teach you anything you want to know,Howard
5884,and with all these new skills you’d be able to fix any model train you’d be the king of the train store,Howard
5885,that’s a turbo,Howard
5886,maybe to you you didn’t get a traffic ticket,Howard
5887,hey if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic then yeah okay,Howard
5888,i have performance anxiety you of all people should know that,Howard
5889,raj who’s at the door,Howard
5890,that’s great now they know where i live,Howard
5891,yeah i would not have done that for you,Howard
5892,all right all right,Howard

5895,why wouldn’t that colonel say what the meeting’s about it has to be bad news,Howard
5896,that’s really stupid advice,Howard
5897,calm down try not to think about it,Howard
5898,why do i bother talking to you,Howard
5899,i don’t know they take the invention away and i get nothing,Howard
5900,what’s the point of that story,Howard
5901,at least she’s yelling at someone else for a change,Howard
5902,as soon as i get home we’re hoping to make it before dark,Howard
5903,well she wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes,Howard
5904,well he wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes,Howard
5905,honey how ya feeling sound of bernadette vomiting violently the book says at this stage of the pregnancy morning sickness should be going away more vomiting so that’s good news right,Howard
5906,there she is who’s ready for a hot threehour car ride to the desert,Howard
5907,i’m sorry we don’t have to go,Howard
5908,how ’bout we stay here we don’t even have to tell anyone it’ll be like a secret vacation at home,Howard

5912,well pulling a quarter out of your ear isn’t the only magic these hands can do in fact what’s this between your toes,Howard

5915,damn so did i,Howard
5916,what are we gonna do email,Howard
5917,you know i rely on humour in times of stress,Howard
5918,is that the hot tub,Howard
5919,well the answer is both more and less disturbing than you think,Howard
5920,stuart he heard me talking about us going away i guess he decided to invite himself over,Howard
5921,maybe how ’bout hey you look like a boiled chicken breast,Howard
5922,nah that’s not gonna hurt his feelings,Howard
5923,maybe this is why people get fish tanks who just turned the porch lights on,Howard
5924,well clearly i lied,Howard
5925,he’s in our hot tub drinking our wine,Howard
5926,those jets are for my secret spot not his,Howard

6021,you’re gonna love it,Howard
6022,okay well i may have gone a bit overboard but you can’t put a price on safety,Howard

6024,in our new minivan hey what’s for lunch,Howard
6025,it’s for the baby and i didn’t buy it the dealer loaned it to me for a hour test drive,Howard

6034,aaaaah what was i thinking wolowitzes are not a lifting people we tip the lifting people,Howard
6035,you’re gonna feel terrible when i’m in a wheelchair which by the way would fit easily in the back of this awardwinning minivan,Howard
6036,you’re right it sells itself,Howard
6037,if childbirth is half this bad you are so screwed are we there yet,Howard
6038,why is it taking so long,Howard
6039,i’m in too much pain to watch cartoo… oh this is a good one,Howard

6049,so you wouldn’t want to have anything on penny,Howard
6050,so if i actually know something right now and i do you don’t want me to tell you,Howard
6051,i’ll take that as a yes she’s secretly been moving your collectibles into storage a little at a time and you haven’t noticed,Howard
6052,see i’ve known that for weeks but you know i waited till the moment when it would cause him the most pain,Howard
6053,it just came up because we we were talking about secrets and… wait juh qachhom dotlh sov ‘iv who knows the status of amy’s apartment,Howard
6054,you’re up blabby,Howard
6055,you know if he moves across the hall for good leonard could keep the stuff you don’t like in sheldon’s old room solves everything,Howard

6065,no,Howard
6066,no,Howard
6067,is that supposed to be funny,Howard

6072,it’s a tradition of my people singing if i were a rich man ya ba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dum,Howard
6073,so what we did was map out the entire room to identify every squeak watch it’s easy,Howard
6074,then simply sit spin stand stretch maybe in looser pants then step grab tiny pivot pull and you’re there easy peasy mac and… you get the idea,Howard
6075,bigger problems i felt something pop,Howard

7397,when did he leave,Raj
7398,no no penny don’t dismiss his feelings,Raj
7399,hang on i’m not saying that his feelings aren’t crazy i just don’t want him to think that this isn’t a safe place,Raj

7431,well sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon but i don’t think that’s happening,Amy

7563,i’m sorry for bringing this over here,Amy
7564,sheldon i understand that you like things a certain way and i’m willing to make some concessions but you have to be open to compromise,Amy

7567,we sleep together once a year you want other partners,Amy
7568,you wanna see other people go see other people,Amy
7569,why is nothing easy with him,Amy
7570,i prefer to think of it as highmaintenance,Amy
7571,i guess i should have known what i was getting myself into,Amy
7572,that’s true,Amy
7573,you’re not making me feel better,Amy
7574,he put a sign up in the bathroom that says number of days without amy’s hair on the soap,Amy
7575,maybe i should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule,Amy

7577,it’s just so much easier to give him what he wants,Amy
7578,me,Amy
7579,me it was mittens,Amy
7580,that was actually koothrappali but i did let him spit it out in my hand,Amy
7581,you know you’re right i’m in this relationship too i need to stand up for myself,Amy
7582,and if he doesn’t like it he can move back here,Amy
7583,it’s a nice enough spot you know if i’m going to start standing up for myself this is exactly the kind of thing…,Amy

7607,hold on i think i might have a little surprise that might help get things back on track,Amy
7608,no,Amy
7609,it’s not about trains,Amy
7610,stop talking about trains,Amy

7618,good then you’re used to this,Amy
7619,you have got to be kidding me,Amy
7620,i understand but this is a special day for them can you just try and let it go,Amy
7621,yeah penny you’re the one who introduced him to bernie,Amy
7622,sheldon and i are living together,Amy
7623,bernadette got her doctorate,Amy
7624,we’ve all come a long way there’s a lot to be proud of,Amy
7625,how’s bernadette,Amy
7626,that’s not a real thing he’s just joking,Amy
7627,kind of hard to see the names,Amy
7628,they all look the same to me,Amy
7629,well that was quite a day,Amy
7630,i was afraid you’d be too tired,Amy
7631,if we’re going to be staying in this apartment would you be interested in doing a little redecorating,Amy
7632,great what’d you have in mind,Amy
7633,well how about we start a little smaller like moving the furniture around,Amy
7634,look we can’t just throw away penny’s stuff but we can ask if she wants any of it back,Amy
7635,well i’m sure she misses this one i mean it’s the greatest gift i’ve ever given anybody,Amy
7636,it may have appreciated in value the artist killed himself shortly after painting that,Amy
7637,i can’t wait to see the look on her face when i give it to her again,Amy
7638,well it would be selfish of me to keep it,Amy
7639,and you,Amy
7640,to give to you,Amy
7641,so do you,Amy
7642,thank you,Amy
7643,sheldon you’re you’re being a little selfish why don’t you let leonard keep a few things,Amy
7644,i don’t think you do but all right,Amy
7645,i’ve got the neosporin who got hurt,Amy
7646,i think he might be right also who is that,Amy
7647,so no one’s gonna tell me okay,Amy
7648,and there was water everywhere it was such a mess,Amy
7649,about five weeks,Amy
7650,well the pipe was over my closet so all my clothes are gone,Amy
7651,they didn’t say,Amy
7652,really,Amy
7653,you’re sure that’s not an inconvenience,Amy
7654,so technically i’d be moving in with my boyfriend,Amy
7655,oh my this is a big step,Amy
7656,what do you think,Amy
7657,sheldon i understand your apprehension but let me appeal to the scientist in you given the fiveweek end date isn’t it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility,Amy
7658,so is that a yes,Amy
7659,sheldon what do you think,Amy
7660,seriously,Amy
7661,oh this is so exciting,Amy
7662,you’ve been roommates with sheldon forever do you have any advice,Amy
7663,i don’t know i didn’t count,Amy
7664,that’s me listen you and i are gonna be sharing a bed you know this is uncharted territory for both of us how are you feeling about that,Amy
7665,well if you’re nervous about the sleeping arrangements maybe we should talk about it,Amy
7666,well i imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations,Amy
7667,look i know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone so why don’t we take being physical off the table and maybe later on once we’re more settled in we can revisit it,Amy
7668,i’ve never lived with someone either this is a lot for me too,Amy
7669,good call seeing your teen titans underwear really got my motor running,Amy
7670,thank you,Amy
7671,shall we,Amy
7672,come on sheldon,Amy
7673,well that’s it for the next five weeks we are officially living together,Amy
7674,doesn’t matter to me your choice,Amy
7675,well sheldon i really appreciate that but these things mean more to you than they do to me so whatever you want,Amy
7676,well i’m not refusing i’m just trying to be considerate,Amy
7677,sheldon will you please just pick a side,Amy
7678,great that’s your side,Amy
7679,okay i’ll take that side,Amy
7680,rising rapidly,Amy
7681,okay what if we do this,Amy
7682,great,Amy
7683,ugh what is that entering why did you switch sides,Amy
7684,comfy,Amy
7685,sheldon i know we took coitus off the table but i was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy such as snuggling,Amy
7686,sheldon i’ve made more than enough accommodations for you we’re both grown adults we’ve been far more intimate than this if you don’t want to snuggle fine but we’re not building a pillow wall,Amy
7687,oh oh oh,Amy
7688,hang on,Amy
7689,i’m so sore i don’t think i slept two minutes last night,Amy
7690,it’s not what you think,Amy
7691,i don’t know if i can make it through five weeks living with him,Amy
7692,miserable and exhausted,Amy
7693,well i didn’t and it’s your fault,Amy
7694,sheldon maybe living together is a bad idea,Amy
7695,the kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night,Amy
7696,i’m sorry are you questioning my integrity as a scientist,Amy
7697,what would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway i mean you wouldn’t know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time and you don’t even get that joke ’cause you don’t even work with confounding variables,Amy
7698,oh you heard me your experimental bona fides are laughable,Amy
7699,can’t make fun of something that’s a null set,Amy
7700,well for science maybe i will,Amy
7701,fine,Amy
7702,good,Amy
7703,do you want to go to our place and make out,Amy
7704,hi,Amy
7705,it was not a great trip,Amy
7706,i rented one of those carts pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest,Amy
7707,so while we’re at your mother’s house it might be a good time to tell her that we’re living together,Amy
7708,maybe there won’t be one,Amy
7709,well she likes me you know there’s a chance she might be okay with it,Amy
7710,thank you for cooking it looks delicious,Amy
7711,well uh howard and bernadette had their baby,Amy
7712,they haven’t said anyway we uh we also have some exciting news to share,Amy
7713,sheldon don’t overreact,Amy
7714,blah blah blah blah blah,Amy
7715,i’ll take over from here,Amy
7716,he’s been in there a long time should i go talk to him,Amy
7717,are you going to,Amy
7718,sheldon what what are you doing,Amy
7719,we’re ignoring the fins okay,Amy
7720,i don’t think that’s what she’s saying,Amy
7721,that’s exactly what she was saying,Amy
7722,well after that sheldon and i got out of the house for a while,Amy
7723,you know i’m sorry your mother made you feel bad but you know at the end of the day she was wrong because you’re not alone,Amy
7724,what about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet,Amy
7725,well let’s try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip,Amy
7726,she was gonna find out eventually,Amy
7727,sheldon i knew your mother was fine with us living together because i already told her we were,Amy
7728,this was a potential issue so i got out ahead of it and i managed the situation for you,Amy
7729,that’s right,Amy
7730,not your whole life i mean science you got that organizing your sock drawer you’re the king but understanding how other people are feeling that’s a weak spot for you,Amy
7731,have you how am i feeling right now,Amy
7732,you and i are in a relationship i help you with your shortcomings and you help me with mine,Amy
7733,delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all,Amy
7734,do you need help,Amy
7735,like the pirate who helps the other pirates connect to the internet,Amy
7736,really you’re never gonna touch their baby,Amy
7737,sheldon,Amy
7738,that was fun thank you,Amy
7739,you know with us living together maybe we could think about having people over,Amy

7808,of course jean buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralysed by indecision and would starve to death,Amy
7809,well i wouldn’t want you to starve to death so here’s an eggplant,Amy
7810,you know some people believe that buridan was plagiarizing aristotle,Amy
7811,although in aristotle’s example he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink,Amy
7812,are you suggesting alghazali was aristotelian ‘cause if anything he was antiaristotelian,Amy
7813,penny is it weird that we’re having girls’ night here but you don’t live here any more so it’s basically my girls’ night,Amy

7859,okay fine let’s say you never win a nobel prize let’s say you spend your life doing solid scientific research surrounded by friends and loved ones who appreciate you not for what you’ve accomplished but for who you are as a man wouldn’t that be a life welllived,Amy
7860,so many warnings,Amy
7861,you know it’s nice of you to acknowledge us but this is your accomplishment,Amy

7879,you know what you need to do is put this air force project behind you and just dive into something new,Amy
7880,oh i don’t know i mean let’s say we succeed in proving that our consciousness creates reality i mean what will we have really accomplished you know a loaf of bread’s still three bucks,Amy
7881,that is true i have said that,Amy
7882,i was offered a summer research fellowship at princeton,Amy
7883,yeah that’s the one,Amy
7884,well i haven’t accepted it yet i wanted to talk to you first,Amy
7885,so are you,Amy
7886,are are you sure,Amy

7888,guys,Amy
7889,i don’t know sheldon’s so vulnerable right now,Amy
7890,of course i get to be part of the first team to use radon markers to map the structures that…,Amy
7891,i know but what if sheldon…,Amy
7892,hey you don’t know what goes on behind closed doors,Amy
7893,all right so you know,Amy
7894,hey you going somewhere,Amy

7934,so welcome to tonight’s episode,Amy
7935,oh hello you’re on fun with flags,Amy
7936,bert is studying the way microbes in rocks can survive in extreme environmental conditions,Amy
7937,you know sheldon maybe if you take the time to actually read bert’s research you’d be less bitter about him winning,Amy
7938,honestly i just want you to be quiet but i’m all out of taffy,Amy
7939,sounds like the night we had coitus,Amy
7940,sheldon it’s foolish to be angry that bert’s work has merit,Amy
7941,what happened,Amy
7942,you know it’s one thing to be envious but now you’re injuring yourself it has to stop,Amy
7943,you know sheldon instead of fixating on what bert has you should appreciate all of the good things in your life you’ve got love you’re in good health you’ve got a roof over your head,Amy
7944,anybody else want to try i’m gonna go make some more tea and question my life choices,Amy
7945,really,Amy
7946,what’s up,Amy
7947,yep,Amy
7948,i can’t believe you headbutted a water fountain,Amy
7949,what about me and sheldon,Amy
7950,ever since i met penny i’ve been envious of her looks,Amy
7951,that’s why i was so happy when you cut your hair off,Amy
7952,you know what i mean you were still hot but more like a why’d that hot girl cut off all her hair hot,Amy
7953,how can you feel bad if stephen hawking says you’re brilliant,Amy
7954,way ahead of you,Amy
7955,it’s just a tiny skin sample you saw me do it to myself,Amy
7956,a two,Amy
7957,sheldon if i’m gonna synthesize a neural network from our skin cells i need to harvest them now i’ve done this dozens of times but if you’re too scared you don’t have to,Amy
7958,thank you,Amy
7959,just think how happy you’ll be in a few weeks when i’ve converted our skin cells into functional brain cells,Amy
7960,okay three two and we’re done,Amy
7961,it didn’t hurt did it,Amy
7962,okay fine one,Amy
7963,if you’d give me a minute i’ll tell you,Amy
7964,those are your eyelashes move well sheldon i see astrocytes our combined skin cells are now a primitive neural network,Amy
7965,these cells come from both of us,Amy
7966,no reason we can’t start right now,Amy
7967,sheldon this is a rudimentary collection of neurons i mean it’s remarkable but it’s still limited in what it can do,Amy
7968,you know most people don’t realize this technique has actually been around for a few years,Amy
7969,well i turned this one into a functioning boyfriend so sky’s the limit,Amy
7970,so enough about us how are things going with you,Amy
7971,good you know in case the exit isn’t clearly marked,Amy
7972,sheldon that’s enough,Amy
7973,i’ve never seen results like this before,Amy
7974,aren’t you glad you participated in this,Amy
7975,set up a second culture and try to replicate our results,Amy
7976,make a baby what are you talking about,Amy
7977,sheldon i’m not ready to have a baby,Amy
7978,wow i i can actually feel the egg crawling its way back up,Amy
7979,not right now,Amy
7980,i’m not playing anything we’re not making a baby today,Amy
7981,no he was explicit needlessly and freakishly explicit,Amy
7982,well there is a genetic component but that doesn’t guarantee anything,Amy
7983,hey you’re talking about the person i love and have been avoiding for the past three hours oh man,Amy
7984,hello,Amy
7985,i don’t think so,Amy
7986,sheldon please stop trying to seduce me,Amy

7988,okay i’ve had enough,Amy
7989,it was like being hit on by rat pack peewee herman,Amy
7990,no,Amy
7991,for god’s sake you’re ridiculous,Amy
7992,that was a close one,Amy
7993,did you say you guys are working on the guidance system tomorrow,Amy
7994,well sheldon said that he was gonna work with me on our quantum perception project,Amy
7995,well he reconfirmed with me this morning,Amy
7996,why did you tell leonard you’re working on the gyroscope tomorrow,Amy
7997,but you said you were working with me,Amy
7998,sheldon this is silly you can’t expect us to do quality work with you popping in and out like this,Amy
7999,incredible sheldon i didn’t expect that you could work on both projects but i i was wrong,Amy
8000,sheldon you’re sick go back to bed,Amy
8001,it’s okay now i don’t need butter,Amy
8002,you need sleep,Amy
8003,well i don’t want your germs around me,Amy

8020,but you are aren’t you,Amy
8021,talk to me tell me what’s going on,Amy
8022,there are a lot of memories wrapped up in that room for me too the first time you told me you loved me was in that room,Amy

8036,you okay,Amy
8037,what’s wrong,Amy
8038,is that bothering you,Amy
8039,i mean how it relates to our relationship not the bromance between you and your brain,Amy
8040,i don’t know i just think you’re the kind of person who likes a contingency plan,Amy
8041,you need to stop hanging out with your brain so much it’s not a good influence,Amy
8042,i want to say aw but i’m gonna say ew,Amy

8059,why didn’t you tell me,Amy
8060,should i worry,Amy
8061,that’s what you said to me when i started dating him and then five years later bingo bango something happened,Amy
8062,you don’t get it i’ve been smacking that ketchup bottle for a long time all she’s got to do is tip it over and point it at her fries,Amy
8063,i don’t know might be the new jersey talking but this nowitzki broad needs to disappear,Amy
8064,yeah but one of those scientists is a tall blonde olympic swimmer,Amy
8065,nice try,Amy
8066,hello sheldon,Amy
8067,i was missing you again,Amy
8068,she’s what,Amy
8069,hi,Amy
8070,uhhuh hang on answering phone hello a little late leonard sorry,Amy
8071,it’s not important,Amy
8072,that’s great how so,Amy
8073,why don’t you ask me what i’m working on,Amy
8074,i’m doing some experiments to show that the signal to move a muscle occurs before you know you even decided to move it,Amy
8075,yes i’m trying to figure out to the nanometer and the attosecond precisely where and when an event of awareness takes place,Amy
8076,you know when i was six i wanted to marry the gorilla from good night gorilla maybe i was onto something,Amy
8077,you know i like harp lessons but i’m thinking of switching to elevator repair lessons what are you working on,Amy
8078,wait are you saying if we combine my experiment with your calculations we can determine the precise moment in time when the wave function collapses,Amy
8079,sheldon this is really interesting,Amy
8080,you know we’ve never collaborated professionally before are you worried it might affect our relationship,Amy
8081,well that would make me feel better,Amy
8082,that’s a ridiculous rule,Amy
8083,oh good what are they,Amy
8084,can i see that,Amy
8085,sheldon if we’re gonna have ground rules i’ll tell you the first ground rule i make the ground rules,Amy
8086,terrific do you want to hear our new set of ground rules,Amy
8087,number one we’re on the same team we’re not in competition,Amy
8088,number two disagreements can happen politely there’s no need to call an idea stupid,Amy
8089,are you listening,Amy
8090,number three to avoid getting frustrated we take builtin breaks and reward our successes with a small treat,Amy
8091,whatever you want so shall we get to work,Amy
8092,wow look at that,Amy
8093,so we’re agreed it’s complete garbage,Amy
8094,i don’t know where we went wrong,Amy
8095,well don’t give up maybe we can fix it,Amy
8096,i can hear your face talking so we’re even,Amy
8097,fine fine you want me to blow my nose here i’ll blow it better,Amy
8098,you know you’re exhausting i knew working together was a bad idea,Amy
8099,that would mean that this delayed parameter should be increased milliseconds,Amy
8100,i had a feeling you were using the wrong computational model but i didn’t say anything ’cause you’re so sensitive,Amy
8101,hey i wonder what kind of success we’d have if we defined measurement as the first moment that an action potential is seen by the visual cortex,Amy
8102,we’re finally making progress i wish we could do it without fighting,Amy
8103,i suppose it’s conceivable that the hormones associated with our fightorflight response could be sharpening our cognitive processes,Amy
8104,how dare you speak that way about my grammy and hey wait a second wait delta t could equal alpha subzero,Amy
8105,there’s only one clear choice,Amy
8106,no you bonehead,Amy
8107,revised ground rule number one we are on the same team but it is a competition,Amy
8108,revised ground rule number two there are definitely stupid questions and those who ask them can be told so right to their stupid face,Amy
8109,thanks babe number three fair topics for insult include educational pedigree scientific field intellectual prowess and mamas,Amy
8110,you’re actually going to comiccon,Amy
8111,well that’s sweet i bet you’ll have fun,Amy
8112,no thanks i already live in a place all the nerds come to,Amy
8113,my aunt’s funeral,Amy
8114,well i’m not going but i do think it’s nice you want to,Amy
8115,look at you going to comiccon talking about ewoks i really have become the cool one around here,Amy
8116,comiccon’s five days,Amy
8117,why don’t you just tell him you don’t want to go,Amy
8118,he is an indoor cat,Amy
8119,penny says they’re ready to go,Amy
8120,sheldon women can wear make up it’s not lying,Amy
8121,wait wait wait what’s leonard lying about,Amy
8122,really because she doesn’t actually want to go she’s just doing it to make him happy,Amy
8123,no you’re not gonna tell them anything you’re gonna stay out of it,Amy
8124,because it’s between them,Amy
8125,hi,Amy
8126,shh,Amy
8127,sure happy to,Amy
8128,because you don’t want her to go to comiccon,Amy
8129,oh my god stop talking,Amy
8130,the place looks great did you guys get a maid,Amy
8131,so you’re not going to comiccon,Amy
8132,sounds like everyone’s staying home what do you say,Amy
8133,by yourself,Amy
8134,i’m not going with you to comiccon,Amy
8135,he can but it’s still not changing my mind,Amy
8136,well we didn’t see you last night we’re not gonna see you today so we thought we could have breakfast together,Amy
8137,well sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon but i don’t think that’s happening,Amy
8138,well to be honest it’s not like a party party it’s more like a gathering where scientists of different disciplines get together to share their work and keep current on what’s going on in other fields i don’t know why i called it a party sorry,Amy
8139,hi bert this is my friend penny,Amy
8140,bert’s a geologist,Amy
8141,oh actually we’re an hour late,Amy
8142,i don’t know where everyone is,Amy
8143,okay i feel so bad about leaving him here,Amy
8144,no,Amy
8145,i’m sure it’s just ’cause i’m dating sheldon,Amy
8146,just the right idea at the right time,Amy
8147,and you thought this wasn’t gonna be a great party,Amy
8148,well it’s not exactly like it we’re all extremely smart,Amy

8156,where did you get empty dove bar wrappers,Amy
8157,well whatever happens we’re here for you,Amy
8158,what,Amy
8159,oh but you did it so well that’s amazing it’s like watching a sculptor but your clay was lies,Amy
8160,i mean seriously you have got to let me scan your brain when you’re being dishonest so i can see what lights up,Amy
8161,i can see a clump of bitch cells lightin’ up from here,Amy
8162,hi howard told me you were working late so i brought dinner,Amy
8163,i spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax,Amy
8164,well i came to see how you were feeling but i’m guessing still angry,Amy
8165,you really think they’re gonna start treating you differently,Amy
8166,i am really regretting that i got you a happy meal,Amy
8167,i understand how you feel,Amy
8168,i wish there were some way i could make it better,Amy
8169,uh actually i got you apple slices ’cause you’re pregnant,Amy

8174,the food here’s supposed to be great don’t fill up on chips,Amy
8175,oh look it’s bert at the bar we should go say hi,Amy
8176,because that’s what you do when you see someone you know in a public place,Amy
8177,sheldon there’s a difference between greeting a friend and following a celebrity into a bathroom,Amy
8178,hi bert,Amy
8179,oh we’re having date night,Amy
8180,oh really anybody we know,Amy
8181,that’s a real thing,Amy

8211,i’m sure it’s extremely frustrating,Amy
8212,and also a little sad,Amy
8213,what do you think,Amy
8214,it’s amazing a machine can do that,Amy
8215,all right now i’m gonna look at some pictures to prompt an emotional response and we’ll see if the machine can identify them accurately,Amy

8264,it’s happening,Amy
8265,you’ll be at the airport an hour before your flight,Amy
8266,sheldon you’re mother’s an attractive woman you need to get use to the fact that men are going to be interested in her,Amy
8267,i will not have you be disrespectful to me,Amy
8268,i told you you can’t regulate every aspect of our lives,Amy
8269,i’m sorry for bringing this over here,Amy
8270,sheldon i understand that you like things a certain way and i’m willing to make some concessions but you have to be open to compromise,Amy
8271,okay well for starters there’s nothing wrong with keeping our toothbrushes in the same holder,Amy
8272,what,Amy
8273,we sleep together once a year you want other partners,Amy
8274,you wanna see other people go see other people,Amy
8275,why is nothing easy with him,Amy
8276,i prefer to think of it as highmaintenance,Amy
8277,i guess i should have known what i was getting myself into,Amy
8278,that’s true,Amy
8279,you’re not making me feel better,Amy
8280,he put a sign up in the bathroom that says number of days without amy’s hair on the soap,Amy
8281,maybe i should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule,Amy
8282,but you did,Amy
8283,it’s just so much easier to give him what he wants,Amy
8284,me,Amy
8285,me it was mittens,Amy
8286,that was actually koothrappali but i did let him spit it out in my hand,Amy
8287,you know you’re right i’m in this relationship too i need to stand up for myself,Amy
8288,and if he doesn’t like it he can move back here,Amy
8289,it’s a nice enough spot you know if i’m going to start standing up for myself this is exactly the kind of thing…,Amy

8303,well should we uh head back up,Amy
8304,oh uh i don’t know sheldon you don’t want to do that do you,Amy

8311,okay that makes sense i mean the mood’s a little different now we we don’t have to rush,Amy
8312,and the mood continues to change,Amy
8313,hold on i think i might have a little surprise that might help get things back on track,Amy
8314,no,Amy
8315,it’s not about trains,Amy
8316,stop talking about trains,Amy
8317,one second all right you can open your eyes i thought i’d let harry potter make things hotter,Amy

8320,wait what just happened,Amy
8321,sheldon do you really want to argue with me on my birthday,Amy
8322,ooh happy birthday to me,Amy
8323,is this about the baby,Amy
8324,good then you’re used to this,Amy
8325,you have got to be kidding me,Amy
8326,i understand but this is a special day for them can you just try and let it go,Amy
8327,yeah penny you’re the one who introduced him to bernie,Amy
8328,sheldon and i are living together,Amy
8329,bernadette got her doctorate,Amy
8330,we’ve all come a long way there’s a lot to be proud of,Amy
8331,how’s bernadette,Amy
8332,that’s not a real thing he’s just joking,Amy
8333,kind of hard to see the names,Amy
8334,they all look the same to me,Amy
8335,well that was quite a day,Amy
8336,i was afraid you’d be too tired,Amy
8337,if we’re going to be staying in this apartment would you be interested in doing a little redecorating,Amy
8338,great what’d you have in mind,Amy
8339,well how about we start a little smaller like moving the furniture around,Amy
8340,look we can’t just throw away penny’s stuff but we can ask if she wants any of it back,Amy
8341,well i’m sure she misses this one i mean it’s the greatest gift i’ve ever given anybody,Amy
8342,it may have appreciated in value the artist killed himself shortly after painting that,Amy
8343,i can’t wait to see the look on her face when i give it to her again,Amy
8344,well it would be selfish of me to keep it,Amy
8345,and you,Amy
8346,to give to you,Amy
8347,so do you,Amy
8348,thank you,Amy
8349,sheldon you’re you’re being a little selfish why don’t you let leonard keep a few things,Amy
8350,i don’t think you do but all right,Amy
8351,i’ve got the neosporin who got hurt,Amy
8352,i think he might be right also who is that,Amy
8353,so no one’s gonna tell me okay,Amy
8354,and there was water everywhere it was such a mess,Amy
8355,about five weeks,Amy
8356,well the pipe was over my closet so all my clothes are gone,Amy
8357,they didn’t say,Amy
8358,really,Amy
8359,you’re sure that’s not an inconvenience,Amy
8360,so technically i’d be moving in with my boyfriend,Amy
8361,oh my this is a big step,Amy
8362,what do you think,Amy
8363,sheldon i understand your apprehension but let me appeal to the scientist in you given the fiveweek end date isn’t it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility,Amy
8364,so is that a yes,Amy
8365,sheldon what do you think,Amy
8366,seriously,Amy
8367,oh this is so exciting,Amy
8368,you’ve been roommates with sheldon forever do you have any advice,Amy
8369,i don’t know i didn’t count,Amy
8370,that’s me listen you and i are gonna be sharing a bed you know this is uncharted territory for both of us how are you feeling about that,Amy
8371,well if you’re nervous about the sleeping arrangements maybe we should talk about it,Amy
8372,well i imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations,Amy
8373,look i know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone so why don’t we take being physical off the table and maybe later on once we’re more settled in we can revisit it,Amy
8374,i’ve never lived with someone either this is a lot for me too,Amy
8375,good call seeing your teen titans underwear really got my motor running,Amy
8376,thank you,Amy
8377,shall we,Amy
8378,come on sheldon,Amy
8379,well that’s it for the next five weeks we are officially living together,Amy
8380,doesn’t matter to me your choice,Amy
8381,well sheldon i really appreciate that but these things mean more to you than they do to me so whatever you want,Amy
8382,well i’m not refusing i’m just trying to be considerate,Amy
8383,sheldon will you please just pick a side,Amy
8384,great that’s your side,Amy
8385,okay i’ll take that side,Amy
8386,rising rapidly,Amy
8387,okay what if we do this,Amy
8388,great,Amy
8389,ugh what is that entering why did you switch sides,Amy
8390,comfy,Amy
8391,sheldon i know we took coitus off the table but i was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy such as snuggling,Amy
8392,sheldon i’ve made more than enough accommodations for you we’re both grown adults we’ve been far more intimate than this if you don’t want to snuggle fine but we’re not building a pillow wall,Amy
8393,oh oh oh,Amy
8394,hang on,Amy
8395,i’m so sore i don’t think i slept two minutes last night,Amy
8396,it’s not what you think,Amy
8397,i don’t know if i can make it through five weeks living with him,Amy
8398,miserable and exhausted,Amy
8399,well i didn’t and it’s your fault,Amy
8400,sheldon maybe living together is a bad idea,Amy
8401,the kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night,Amy
8402,i’m sorry are you questioning my integrity as a scientist,Amy
8403,what would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway i mean you wouldn’t know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time and you don’t even get that joke ’cause you don’t even work with confounding variables,Amy
8404,oh you heard me your experimental bona fides are laughable,Amy
8405,can’t make fun of something that’s a null set,Amy
8406,well for science maybe i will,Amy
8407,fine,Amy
8408,good,Amy
8409,do you want to go to our place and make out,Amy
8410,hi,Amy
8411,it was not a great trip,Amy
8412,i rented one of those carts pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest,Amy
8413,so while we’re at your mother’s house it might be a good time to tell her that we’re living together,Amy
8414,maybe there won’t be one,Amy
8415,well she likes me you know there’s a chance she might be okay with it,Amy
8416,thank you for cooking it looks delicious,Amy
8417,well uh howard and bernadette had their baby,Amy
8418,they haven’t said anyway we uh we also have some exciting news to share,Amy
8419,sheldon don’t overreact,Amy
8420,blah blah blah blah blah,Amy
8421,i’ll take over from here,Amy
8422,he’s been in there a long time should i go talk to him,Amy
8423,are you going to,Amy
8424,sheldon what what are you doing,Amy
8425,we’re ignoring the fins okay,Amy
8426,i don’t think that’s what she’s saying,Amy
8427,that’s exactly what she was saying,Amy
8428,well after that sheldon and i got out of the house for a while,Amy
8429,you know i’m sorry your mother made you feel bad but you know at the end of the day she was wrong because you’re not alone,Amy
8430,what about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet,Amy
8431,well let’s try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip,Amy
8432,she was gonna find out eventually,Amy
8433,sheldon i knew your mother was fine with us living together because i already told her we were,Amy
8434,this was a potential issue so i got out ahead of it and i managed the situation for you,Amy
8435,that’s right,Amy
8436,not your whole life i mean science you got that organizing your sock drawer you’re the king but understanding how other people are feeling that’s a weak spot for you,Amy
8437,have you how am i feeling right now,Amy
8438,you and i are in a relationship i help you with your shortcomings and you help me with mine,Amy
8439,delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all,Amy
8440,do you need help,Amy
8441,like the pirate who helps the other pirates connect to the internet,Amy
8442,really you’re never gonna touch their baby,Amy
8443,sheldon,Amy
8444,that was fun thank you,Amy
8445,you know with us living together maybe we could think about having people over,Amy

8480,well the drywall got wet and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall gets wet it’s really more…,Amy
8481,or damp wall just as bad,Amy

8510,what is happening,Amy
8511,hi,Amy
8512,what are you doing,Amy
8513,i understand i’ll leave you be,Amy
8514,of course jean buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralysed by indecision and would starve to death,Amy
8515,well i wouldn’t want you to starve to death so here’s an eggplant,Amy
8516,you know some people believe that buridan was plagiarizing aristotle,Amy
8517,although in aristotle’s example he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink,Amy
8518,are you suggesting alghazali was aristotelian ‘cause if anything he was antiaristotelian,Amy
8519,penny is it weird that we’re having girls’ night here but you don’t live here any more so it’s basically my girls’ night,Amy
8520,but now you’re thinking about it and it bothers you i get that,Amy

8533,i don’t know the protocol are you gonna be naked for your massage,Amy
8534,hmm then this is probably too many clothes,Amy
8535,nice to see you too,Amy
8536,sheldon why don’t we give them some privacy,Amy
8537,uhhuh,Amy
8538,it’s there on purpose it’s refreshing,Amy

8540,i remember signing our first relationship agreement,Amy
8541,right right got it,Amy
8542,i’m pretty sure that’s a myth let me check,Amy
8543,to denial,Amy
8544,hey,Amy
8545,what smells so good,Amy
8546,is this part of your superaging,Amy
8547,well clearly mental tasks are not enough maybe you need to challenge your motor skills,Amy
8548,how did you get from croissants to a unicycle,Amy
8549,where did you get it,Amy
8550,have you tried letting go of the rope,Amy
8551,all right well have fun,Amy
8552,well what do you want me to do,Amy
8553,what are you doing,Amy

8555,you said juggling was dumb too,Amy
8556,sheldon is it possible that when things get really difficult you just give up,Amy
8557,well if you honestly…,Amy
8558,his mother warned me everybody warned me actually he warned me,Amy
8559,i made you tea,Amy
8560,i’m sorry i called you a quitter,Amy
8561,what are you reading,Amy
8562,so,Amy
8563,that’s ridiculous you’re a brilliant man the best years of your life are still ahead of you,Amy
8564,well if you’re really worried about your career maybe you should consider spending a little less time with video games and comic books,Amy
8565,okay fine let’s say you never win a nobel prize let’s say you spend your life doing solid scientific research surrounded by friends and loved ones who appreciate you not for what you’ve accomplished but for who you are as a man wouldn’t that be a life welllived,Amy
8566,so many warnings,Amy
8567,you know it’s nice of you to acknowledge us but this is your accomplishment,Amy
8568,where are you moving,Amy
8569,well good for you i actually have a little news myself,Amy
8570,i was uh asked to be a visiting researcher at princeton,Amy
8571,thanks but the thing is i’ll be gone for a few months and i don’t know how sheldon’s gonna feel about that,Amy

8584,sheldon you’re you’re being silly,Amy
8585,you know what you need to do is put this air force project behind you and just dive into something new,Amy
8586,oh i don’t know i mean let’s say we succeed in proving that our consciousness creates reality i mean what will we have really accomplished you know a loaf of bread’s still three bucks,Amy
8587,that is true i have said that,Amy

8606,that’s a risk i’m willing to take,Amy
8607,what if we don’t fold our clothes at all,Amy
8608,my goodness that form of stimulation is highly efficient,Amy
8609,okay the car is waiting do you want to walk me downstairs,Amy
8610,is it,Amy
8611,do you think it’s possible you might enjoy being on your own for a little while,Amy

8640,so welcome to tonight’s episode,Amy
8641,oh hello you’re on fun with flags,Amy
8642,bert is studying the way microbes in rocks can survive in extreme environmental conditions,Amy
8643,you know sheldon maybe if you take the time to actually read bert’s research you’d be less bitter about him winning,Amy
8644,honestly i just want you to be quiet but i’m all out of taffy,Amy
8645,sounds like the night we had coitus,Amy
8646,sheldon it’s foolish to be angry that bert’s work has merit,Amy
8647,what happened,Amy
8648,you know it’s one thing to be envious but now you’re injuring yourself it has to stop,Amy
8649,you know sheldon instead of fixating on what bert has you should appreciate all of the good things in your life you’ve got love you’re in good health you’ve got a roof over your head,Amy
8650,anybody else want to try i’m gonna go make some more tea and question my life choices,Amy
8651,really,Amy
8652,what’s up,Amy
8653,yep,Amy
8654,i can’t believe you headbutted a water fountain,Amy
8655,what about me and sheldon,Amy
8656,ever since i met penny i’ve been envious of her looks,Amy
8657,that’s why i was so happy when you cut your hair off,Amy
8658,you know what i mean you were still hot but more like a why’d that hot girl cut off all her hair hot,Amy
8659,how can you feel bad if stephen hawking says you’re brilliant,Amy
8660,way ahead of you,Amy
8661,it’s just a tiny skin sample you saw me do it to myself,Amy
8662,a two,Amy
8663,sheldon if i’m gonna synthesize a neural network from our skin cells i need to harvest them now i’ve done this dozens of times but if you’re too scared you don’t have to,Amy
8664,thank you,Amy
8665,just think how happy you’ll be in a few weeks when i’ve converted our skin cells into functional brain cells,Amy
8666,okay three two and we’re done,Amy
8667,it didn’t hurt did it,Amy
8668,okay fine one,Amy
8669,if you’d give me a minute i’ll tell you,Amy
8670,those are your eyelashes move well sheldon i see astrocytes our combined skin cells are now a primitive neural network,Amy
8671,these cells come from both of us,Amy
8672,no reason we can’t start right now,Amy
8673,sheldon this is a rudimentary collection of neurons i mean it’s remarkable but it’s still limited in what it can do,Amy
8674,you know most people don’t realize this technique has actually been around for a few years,Amy
8675,well i turned this one into a functioning boyfriend so sky’s the limit,Amy
8676,so enough about us how are things going with you,Amy
8677,good you know in case the exit isn’t clearly marked,Amy
8678,sheldon that’s enough,Amy
8679,i’ve never seen results like this before,Amy
8680,aren’t you glad you participated in this,Amy
8681,set up a second culture and try to replicate our results,Amy
8682,make a baby what are you talking about,Amy
8683,sheldon i’m not ready to have a baby,Amy
8684,wow i i can actually feel the egg crawling its way back up,Amy
8685,not right now,Amy
8686,i’m not playing anything we’re not making a baby today,Amy
8687,no he was explicit needlessly and freakishly explicit,Amy
8688,well there is a genetic component but that doesn’t guarantee anything,Amy
8689,hey you’re talking about the person i love and have been avoiding for the past three hours oh man,Amy
8690,hello,Amy
8691,i don’t think so,Amy

8695,it was like being hit on by rat pack peewee herman,Amy
8696,no,Amy
8697,for god’s sake you’re ridiculous,Amy
8698,that was a close one,Amy
8699,did you say you guys are working on the guidance system tomorrow,Amy
8700,well sheldon said that he was gonna work with me on our quantum perception project,Amy
8701,well he reconfirmed with me this morning,Amy
8702,why did you tell leonard you’re working on the gyroscope tomorrow,Amy
8703,but you said you were working with me,Amy
8704,sheldon this is silly you can’t expect us to do quality work with you popping in and out like this,Amy
8705,incredible sheldon i didn’t expect that you could work on both projects but i i was wrong,Amy
8706,sheldon you’re sick go back to bed,Amy
8707,it’s okay now i don’t need butter,Amy
8708,you need sleep,Amy

8742,you okay,Amy
8743,what’s wrong,Amy
8744,is that bothering you,Amy
8745,i mean how it relates to our relationship not the bromance between you and your brain,Amy
8746,i don’t know i just think you’re the kind of person who likes a contingency plan,Amy
8747,you need to stop hanging out with your brain so much it’s not a good influence,Amy
8748,i want to say aw but i’m gonna say ew,Amy

8765,why didn’t you tell me,Amy
8766,should i worry,Amy
8767,that’s what you said to me when i started dating him and then five years later bingo bango something happened,Amy
8768,you don’t get it i’ve been smacking that ketchup bottle for a long time all she’s got to do is tip it over and point it at her fries,Amy
8769,i don’t know might be the new jersey talking but this nowitzki broad needs to disappear,Amy
8770,yeah but one of those scientists is a tall blonde olympic swimmer,Amy
8771,nice try,Amy
8772,hello sheldon,Amy
8773,i was missing you again,Amy
8774,she’s what,Amy
8775,hi,Amy
8776,uhhuh hang on answering phone hello a little late leonard sorry,Amy
8777,it’s not important,Amy
8778,that’s great how so,Amy
8779,why don’t you ask me what i’m working on,Amy
8780,i’m doing some experiments to show that the signal to move a muscle occurs before you know you even decided to move it,Amy
8781,yes i’m trying to figure out to the nanometer and the attosecond precisely where and when an event of awareness takes place,Amy
8782,you know when i was six i wanted to marry the gorilla from good night gorilla maybe i was onto something,Amy
8783,you know i like harp lessons but i’m thinking of switching to elevator repair lessons what are you working on,Amy
8784,wait are you saying if we combine my experiment with your calculations we can determine the precise moment in time when the wave function collapses,Amy
8785,sheldon this is really interesting,Amy
8786,you know we’ve never collaborated professionally before are you worried it might affect our relationship,Amy
8787,well that would make me feel better,Amy
8788,that’s a ridiculous rule,Amy
8789,oh good what are they,Amy
8790,can i see that,Amy
8791,sheldon if we’re gonna have ground rules i’ll tell you the first ground rule i make the ground rules,Amy
8792,terrific do you want to hear our new set of ground rules,Amy
8793,number one we’re on the same team we’re not in competition,Amy
8794,number two disagreements can happen politely there’s no need to call an idea stupid,Amy
8795,are you listening,Amy
8796,number three to avoid getting frustrated we take builtin breaks and reward our successes with a small treat,Amy
8797,whatever you want so shall we get to work,Amy
8798,wow look at that,Amy
8799,so we’re agreed it’s complete garbage,Amy
8800,i don’t know where we went wrong,Amy
8801,well don’t give up maybe we can fix it,Amy
8802,i can hear your face talking so we’re even,Amy
8803,fine fine you want me to blow my nose here i’ll blow it better,Amy
8804,you know you’re exhausting i knew working together was a bad idea,Amy
8805,that would mean that this delayed parameter should be increased milliseconds,Amy
8806,i had a feeling you were using the wrong computational model but i didn’t say anything ’cause you’re so sensitive,Amy
8807,hey i wonder what kind of success we’d have if we defined measurement as the first moment that an action potential is seen by the visual cortex,Amy
8808,we’re finally making progress i wish we could do it without fighting,Amy
8809,i suppose it’s conceivable that the hormones associated with our fightorflight response could be sharpening our cognitive processes,Amy
8810,how dare you speak that way about my grammy and hey wait a second wait delta t could equal alpha subzero,Amy
8811,there’s only one clear choice,Amy
8812,no you bonehead,Amy
8813,revised ground rule number one we are on the same team but it is a competition,Amy
8814,revised ground rule number two there are definitely stupid questions and those who ask them can be told so right to their stupid face,Amy
8815,thanks babe number three fair topics for insult include educational pedigree scientific field intellectual prowess and mamas,Amy
8816,okay,Bernadette
8817,making lasagna,Bernadette
8818,you want something stupid or you did something stupid,Bernadette

8852,oh i was gonna start at the end thank god you’re here,Bernadette
8853,sorry i should probably keep this in case we have a girl,Bernadette
8854,my dad built it for me,Bernadette
8855,this was the husband and this was the wife they’d go out on adventures together cruises skiing horseback riding that was really me just duct taping them to our dog,Bernadette
8856,they did but the mommy and daddy didn’t like them so they shipped them off to an orphanage i made out of a shoebox,Bernadette
8857,not every girl dreams about being a mom sometimes you think you’re never gonna have kids and one day you wake up and you’re pregnant and it doesn’t matter that your career’s going great right now and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere taped to a dog,Bernadette
8858,sorry i flipped out on you i think it’s just hormones,Bernadette
8859,does it really need one,Bernadette
8860,well it doubled as my dad’s office and he was a cop so i guess the theme was bloody homicide photos,Bernadette

8867,i keep waiting to feel excited but it’s not happening what if it never happens,Bernadette
8868,once i was supposed to babysit my brothers our neighbour found them naked in the backyard eating crickets,Bernadette
8869,what why who are you calling you’re gonna rat me out to howard aren’t you you’re such a snitch no wonder i don’t like you,Bernadette
8870,something’s wrong i don’t care about any of the baby stuff every other mom is so into honestly i’m not even sure i like babies,Bernadette
8871,but i thought i’d be more excited,Bernadette
8872,thank you i feel better now,Bernadette
8873,i’m worried about howard ever since that guy from the air force showed up he’s been a nervous wreck,Bernadette
8874,he won’t take any pills that aren’t chewable and shaped like a flintstone,Bernadette
8875,i don’t believe this,Bernadette
8876,this guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant,Bernadette
8877,no one at the office did did you tell anyone,Bernadette
8878,i bet it was barbara chen in retrovirus she might have heard me throwing up one morning every since she got the hearing aid she thinks she’s so great,Bernadette
8879,‘cause i’m up for a major immunotherapy study and if they find out i’m pregnant they might give it to someone else,Bernadette
8880,i know they would they did it to barbara chen last year when i told everyone she was pregnant,Bernadette

8890,it had to be barbara i’ve been trying to figure out a way to get back at her do you think using her work computer to google how to be a prostitute is over the line,Bernadette
8891,what kind of revenge is that this woman screwed with my job she’s got to pay,Bernadette
8892,why did you do that,Bernadette

9167,well sloth babies cling to their mothers’ bodies for almost a year i’m going back to work after only four months so i’ve learned i hate myself i hate sloths and i hate you for bringing me here,Bernadette
9168,it’s not just the sloth polar bears nurse their cubs for almost eight months the orangutan mother builds her baby a new home every night and what do i do i choose my career over my child,Bernadette
9169,yeah eventually she’s still not happy about taking a bottle though,Bernadette

9208,yeah i mean with you and my parents she’s gonna be fine,Bernadette
9209,and that day care is great,Bernadette
9210,plus i i think i’m setting a good example for halley to show her that women can be mothers and still have satisfying careers sure she won’t know where i went or if i’m ever coming back that’ll just make the ten minutes between when i get home and her bedtime even more special,Bernadette
9211,it’s okay i’m just being emotional about this can you not tell howard,Bernadette
9212,don’t you think it’d be healthier if you had your own apartment grown man,Bernadette

9307,my dad built it for me,Bernadette
9308,this was the husband and this was the wife they’d go out on adventures together cruises skiing horseback riding that was really me just duct taping them to our dog,Bernadette
9309,they did but the mommy and daddy didn’t like them so they shipped them off to an orphanage i made out of a shoebox,Bernadette
9310,not every girl dreams about being a mom sometimes you think you’re never gonna have kids and one day you wake up and you’re pregnant and it doesn’t matter that your career’s going great right now and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere taped to a dog,Bernadette
9311,sorry i flipped out on you i think it’s just hormones,Bernadette
9312,does it really need one,Bernadette
9313,well it doubled as my dad’s office and he was a cop so i guess the theme was bloody homicide photos,Bernadette

9321,once i was supposed to babysit my brothers our neighbour found them naked in the backyard eating crickets,Bernadette
9322,what why who are you calling you’re gonna rat me out to howard aren’t you you’re such a snitch no wonder i don’t like you,Bernadette
9323,something’s wrong i don’t care about any of the baby stuff every other mom is so into honestly i’m not even sure i like babies,Bernadette
9324,but i thought i’d be more excited,Bernadette
9325,thank you i feel better now,Bernadette
9326,i’m worried about howard ever since that guy from the air force showed up he’s been a nervous wreck,Bernadette
9327,he won’t take any pills that aren’t chewable and shaped like a flintstone,Bernadette
9328,i don’t believe this,Bernadette
9329,this guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant,Bernadette
9330,no one at the office did did you tell anyone,Bernadette
9331,i bet it was barbara chen in retrovirus she might have heard me throwing up one morning every since she got the hearing aid she thinks she’s so great,Bernadette
9332,‘cause i’m up for a major immunotherapy study and if they find out i’m pregnant they might give it to someone else,Bernadette
9333,i know they would they did it to barbara chen last year when i told everyone she was pregnant,Bernadette
9334,i had a plan i kept leaving dove bar wrappers around to explain any weight gain,Bernadette
9335,from all the dove bars i ate i’m pregnant try to keep up i’m sorry i have to go find out if my boss knows,Bernadette

9343,it had to be barbara i’ve been trying to figure out a way to get back at her do you think using her work computer to google how to be a prostitute is over the line,Bernadette
9344,what kind of revenge is that this woman screwed with my job she’s got to pay,Bernadette
9345,why did you do that,Bernadette
9346,get out,Bernadette
9347,oh thanks you know i just wanted to get some work done without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes,Bernadette

9661,yeah i mean with you and my parents she’s gonna be fine,Bernadette
9662,and that day care is great,Bernadette
9663,plus i i think i’m setting a good example for halley to show her that women can be mothers and still have satisfying careers sure she won’t know where i went or if i’m ever coming back that’ll just make the ten minutes between when i get home and her bedtime even more special,Bernadette
9664,it’s okay i’m just being emotional about this can you not tell howard,Bernadette
9665,don’t you think it’d be healthier if you had your own apartment grown man,Bernadette

9683,i guess,Bernadette
9684,i’m not crazy about you calling our baby dumb,Bernadette
