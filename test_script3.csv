27,why are you all smiling like crazy people cohabitation with my girlfriend that’s a great deal to process i don’t know what if living together kills the romance yeah but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain i mean she’s never even seen me unshaven don’t try luring me in with sexy talk if you want to lure me in with sexy talk that’s how you do it not yet how will i learn if i’m comfortable living with amy or just comfortable because i’m in my own apartment now if this experiment is going to be valid i suggest a neutral environment well ideally an enclosed selfsustaining biodome in new mexico where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste interesting if my official residence were across the hall i wonder if i’d need to knock every time i came over here historically i don’t do well with change you’re darn right you wouldn’t no matter where i am this will always be my spot like an embassy in a foreign country this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom very well i’m on board yes i accept this fiveweek mission to share a living space with my girlfriend well now don’t be surprised if like star trek it’s cancelled in three oh thank you of course the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical sheldons and amys one pair that was neither dating nor living together one pair that was dating but not living together one pair that was living together but not dating and then of course one pair that was living together and dating although with that many sheldons it’d be such a party we’d never get anything done well you’ve lived with your significant other for some time i would like this experiment to go well are there any insights you can share you know leonard and i were very happy before you came along how many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move you truly are the goofus to my gallant oh excited concerned a little scared all the same emotions i feel in line at space mountain okay talk wow no foreplay or anything just right to it you’re really okay with that this is such a relief honestly if it didn’t get you all worked up i’d kiss you right now i know they probably shouldn’t sell those to children enjoy having the place to yourselves it’s penny’s bedroom plenty of men have gone before i guess this is it you too oh don’t forget tuesday the air filters need to be changed oh oh and every other day check the water level on the avocado pit leonard please let me go oh bye i guess the experiment begins which side of the bed would you prefer no no we’re living together now everything’s equal you know i know that i have a tendency to be controlling so i would rather you choose well clearly it’s not whatever i want because what i want is for you to make this decision and you refuse to do that like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom and then watched me roll right into traffic fine okay now on this side i am closer to the exit in case of emergency no but i’m also closer to the entrance in case of attack ah then again what are the odds of someone attacking me now this side offers me proximity to the bathroom but i am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep i suppose that works although now i’m kind of worried someone’s hiding behind those drapes be grateful i’m still in the room oh i’m just happy i don’t know what this memory foam remembers well it’s funny you should ask because i was wondering how you’d feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall okay well i am sorry i’m just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night and no offence but your bottom radiates enough heat i’m surprised there aren’t iguanas lying on it no dr feynman if i solve it for you you’ll never learn what are you doing down there who are you calling aaargh good morning see i didn’t knock but it’s fine i didn’t knock but it’s fine i didn’t knock but it’s fine so how is everyone really i slept great how you had the whole floor to yourself well but what kind of scientists would we be drawing a conclusion after only hours of data wow i anticipated we’d have problems but i never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them if the lab room disposable shoe cover fits how dare you whoa whoa now you’re making fun of my bona fides well if you are so protective of the scientific method perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started for science maybe you should fine great does stephen hawking roll through the quad,Sheldon

41,i know our apartment’s small but i think we can make room wow i’m starting to think you didn’t mean it when you said you wanted to spruce up the place hi uh penny this circular is addressed to occupant but with our apartment switch it’s unclear whether it’s yours or mine roofing okay thanks just throw it out speaking of occupants i’m given to understand raj will be moving into my old room what about his dog i suppose that’s acceptable if real dogs gave me buttons i’d like them too well i think it’s very nice that you’re helping out our friend and what is that supposed to mean if you’re implying that i’d have some problem with him moving into my room you’re wrong raj is in a difficult financial situation and i’m glad that he’s making changes to improve it i mean it’s unfair people just assume i’m going to be upset by raj moving into my old room oh i’m outraged well that’s been my room since before i met leonard and now someone else is going to be living in it and that someone else is not me and you know how i feel about people who aren’t me wrong we were standing outside my room in the hallway i realize it’s irrational but with raj moving in there i’m feeling a bit replaced yes probably but until we know for sure how can i feel better all set a housewarming gift for raj it’s nothing like that i just i thought about raj’s situation and i had a change of heart you know and regarding your gift you said surprise me and boy did i hello uh wait before we eat i have a little welcome to the building gift for raj well i had some of my best ideas in that room and i’m sure you will too well i know this is a difficult time for you you’re losing your apartment you’re in debt and you just you must be humiliated oh good grief she is such a stickler for citing sources those were amy’s words i know i know good grief was originally said by charlie brown geez can you believe this guy i thought that was gonna break the other way fine you took my room you turned my friends against me i hope you’re happy how come he can say it and i can’t honestly i’ve been better do you have time leonard says you’re very busy these days well our friend raj moved into my old room and it’s brought up a lot of negative feelings for me beverley you know i hold you in high esteem can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer and get to the part where you tell me the answer i have i hadn’t thought about that i had no idea all our relationships were such a disaster boy you’re good hey raj i owe you an apology look could you please put your dog on a leash well then at least hold her still so i can pretend she’s stuffed raj i let my emotions get the best of me and i unfairly took it out on you no i can’t take all the credit i spoke with leonard’s mother and she made me feel better beverly pointed out that i’m experiencing insecurities in my relationship with amy in the same way that leonard and penny are in their relationship yes you’re fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems it used to be me now it’s raj and his attack tribble anyway i’m sorry for everything oh and fyi if you cry while they’re fighting they’ll take you to mcdonald’s i can’t sleep beverley believes i unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch yes i don’t care for unconscious thoughts my brain and i are best friends it should tell me everything what if she’s correct doesn’t that say something troubling about us that is true did you know i figured out in which order i would eat all my friends in the event of an apocalypse penny would be the entree then leonard’s basically a cheese course and because i love you you’re dessert amy quick lock the door you know what i’m proud of us yeah with penny and leonard taking in raj and stuart living with howard and bernadette we’re the only couple of our social group who doesn’t need to fill the holes in their relationship with a third party,Sheldon
42,things have been going really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope oh the project is classified i can’t tell you oh i suppose i could redact the classified parts all right um i came up with an elegant solution to the honks horn i used the honks horn and then i honks horn and that did it car passes honking horn wow i wonder what they’re redacting oh very well what have you been working on and feel free to honk during the boring parts so you’re attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain well what do you know here i was waiting to be bored with biology and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy which unlike my body is an okay place to tickle gentlemen the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon yeah i picked it up without thinking about it which raises a neuroscientific question when did i decide to pick it up amy is studying the time lag between intent and awareness and i realized that applies to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics now i recognize there will be a time lag between me saying that and you googling what it means so i’ll wait well don’t get me wrong neurobiology’s nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff but you know when it connects to physics gas up the ford martha we’re going for a drive i was thinking about your experiment on the neuroscience of decision making and i realized if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness in the copenhagen interpretation it could be the most inspired combination since i mixed red icee into my blue icee it was like drinking two sevenths of the rainbow yeah and this one won’t stain my teeth purple that is a valid point perhaps we should establish some ground rules all right let’s start right now uh rule number one no using sexuality to get your way is it i believe i’ve made some progress on our ground rules okay uh number one in matters of physics i have the final say in matters of neuroscience you have the final say unless i disagree oh here number two when we publish oh of course i’ll get that back like all my underwear that notebook says property of sheldon cooper i’d write that down but i can’t now can i thank you you are a good citizen told you go ahead throw my underwear out the window same thing’s gonna happen fire away that’s smart because sheldon amy aw someone drew a penis in it i’m sorry go ahead ooh that sounds fun now we’re talking about real treats right not bible verses like my mother used to give me biology and physics coming together this is like the peanut butter cup of the mind oh i know what i want my treat to be yes this is remarkable by the way your name can go first yeah the math is so inelegant i’m not even sure it makes sense can you stop breathing so loud i can hear your nose whistling all right either blow your nose or teach it to play camptown races no i can still hear it oh wait that’s me never mind it’s fine hold on i see what’s wrong here we did the propagation only to the occipital lobe not to the prefrontal cortex oh that is much better yeah boy if good ideas came out of your brain the way mucus comes out of your nose we’d be in good shape just because i am easily bothered by light heat sound smell and the way birds look at me does not mean i’m sensitive that is a daring and insightful solution what if the fighting is the reason we’re making progress well if that’s the case then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture it seems we have a choice to make abandon all ground rules in the name of science or give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship science it is name calling that is perfect now when i get to this equation here really let me have it you know if it helps i’m not the sharpest dresser can you read them back excellent excellent and on a related point you’re going down punk i love that one yeah that list is strong like your mother’s urge to be promiscuous with sailors,Sheldon

123,and there was water everywhere it was such a mess about five weeks well the pipe was over my closet so all my clothes are gone they didn’t say really you’re sure that’s not an inconvenience so technically i’d be moving in with my boyfriend oh my this is a big step what do you think sheldon i understand your apprehension but let me appeal to the scientist in you given the fiveweek end date isn’t it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility so is that a yes sheldon what do you think seriously oh this is so exciting you’ve been roommates with sheldon forever do you have any advice i don’t know i didn’t count that’s me listen you and i are gonna be sharing a bed you know this is uncharted territory for both of us how are you feeling about that well if you’re nervous about the sleeping arrangements maybe we should talk about it well i imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations look i know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone so why don’t we take being physical off the table and maybe later on once we’re more settled in we can revisit it i’ve never lived with someone either this is a lot for me too good call seeing your teen titans underwear really got my motor running thank you shall we come on sheldon well that’s it for the next five weeks we are officially living together doesn’t matter to me your choice well sheldon i really appreciate that but these things mean more to you than they do to me so whatever you want well i’m not refusing i’m just trying to be considerate sheldon will you please just pick a side great that’s your side okay i’ll take that side rising rapidly okay what if we do this great ugh what is that entering why did you switch sides comfy sheldon i know we took coitus off the table but i was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy such as snuggling sheldon i’ve made more than enough accommodations for you we’re both grown adults we’ve been far more intimate than this if you don’t want to snuggle fine but we’re not building a pillow wall oh oh oh hang on i’m so sore i don’t think i slept two minutes last night it’s not what you think i don’t know if i can make it through five weeks living with him miserable and exhausted well i didn’t and it’s your fault sheldon maybe living together is a bad idea the kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night i’m sorry are you questioning my integrity as a scientist what would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway i mean you wouldn’t know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time and you don’t even get that joke ’cause you don’t even work with confounding variables oh you heard me your experimental bona fides are laughable can’t make fun of something that’s a null set well for science maybe i will fine good do you want to go to our place and make out,Amy
124,i told you you can’t regulate every aspect of our lives i’m sorry for bringing this over here sheldon i understand that you like things a certain way and i’m willing to make some concessions but you have to be open to compromise okay well for starters there’s nothing wrong with keeping our toothbrushes in the same holder what we sleep together once a year you want other partners you wanna see other people go see other people why is nothing easy with him i prefer to think of it as highmaintenance i guess i should have known what i was getting myself into that’s true you’re not making me feel better he put a sign up in the bathroom that says number of days without amy’s hair on the soap maybe i should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule but you did it’s just so much easier to give him what he wants me me it was mittens that was actually koothrappali but i did let him spit it out in my hand you know you’re right i’m in this relationship too i need to stand up for myself and if he doesn’t like it he can move back here it’s a nice enough spot you know if i’m going to start standing up for myself this is exactly the kind of thing… oh hi hi oh really i would love to,Amy
125,you know with us living together maybe we could think about having people over you know what i meant i’m sorry i mentioned it what’s going on here well that’s so nice who’s coming you mean the romanian lady on the second floor that’s an odd mix of people you never went into that haunted house well thank you sheldon this is a fun surprise well that’s not a surprise at all i mean if i knew you were good at surprises i would have there’s nothing to be afraid of sheldon been minutes just sayin’ how old was it hi stuart oh they’re pretty thank you things didn’t work out uh no he he just means that you were the first people we thought of stuart you know you’re one of our favourite people no stuart don’t we’re so sorry cheers maybe i can get a little help putting some of this stuff away,Amy
126,and i’m dr amy farrah fowler as you may notice just one of the changes around here is our new house band we’re also coming to you live from a different apartment so in the spirit of cohabitation the theme of today’s episode is flags of two regions coming together as one such as the flag of st kitts and nevis did you know that the flag was designed by a student named edrice lewis… it’s almost dinner time you in the mood for anything oh you don’t want do that it’s a construction zone well what about your fear of stray nails and butt cracks anyway how about dinner thanks but you don’t have to good stuff so uh what about dinner no and on the subject of subjects is your use of the word subject the same or different as when we speak about the subject of a king um it was a drywall problem well the drywall got wet and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall gets wet it’s really more… or damp wall just as bad well they went to get some but the woman at the wall store said it was going on sale and they should wait because the savings… i was done at wet wall but you wouldn’t let it go well he started to question it but then i fake sneezed on him and he ran to take a shower please don’t say anything i feel terrible about this thanks let it go food’s here oh uh they’re still working on it why are you speaking klingon this is ridiculous penny do you remember when i taught you ubbi dubbi ubexcubellent duboes shubeldubon knubow ubi’m lubyubing you stop that penny was just covering for me my place has been ready for two weeks everybody stop it with that and i’d like to know why you blabbed about my apartment i guess it’s okay i’m sorry that i lied about my apartment are you saying you’d like to live with me whatever thank you for understanding good night i don’t know it it could be sure sure we we could live in my apartment sorry you brought it up it’s kind of exciting i mean we could do whatever we want yes sorry what’s going on can it be more of an internal struggle how about if i just don’t breathe at all what is happening hi what are you doing i understand i’ll leave you be of course jean buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralysed by indecision and would starve to death well i wouldn’t want you to starve to death so here’s an eggplant you know some people believe that buridan was plagiarizing aristotle although in aristotle’s example he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink are you suggesting alghazali was aristotelian ‘cause if anything he was antiaristotelian,Amy
127,it’s just a tiny skin sample you saw me do it to myself a two sheldon if i’m gonna synthesize a neural network from our skin cells i need to harvest them now i’ve done this dozens of times but if you’re too scared you don’t have to thank you just think how happy you’ll be in a few weeks when i’ve converted our skin cells into functional brain cells okay three two and we’re done it didn’t hurt did it okay fine one if you’d give me a minute i’ll tell you those are your eyelashes move well sheldon i see astrocytes our combined skin cells are now a primitive neural network these cells come from both of us no reason we can’t start right now sheldon this is a rudimentary collection of neurons i mean it’s remarkable but it’s still limited in what it can do you know most people don’t realize this technique has actually been around for a few years well i turned this one into a functioning boyfriend so sky’s the limit so enough about us how are things going with you good you know in case the exit isn’t clearly marked sheldon that’s enough i’ve never seen results like this before aren’t you glad you participated in this set up a second culture and try to replicate our results make a baby what are you talking about sheldon i’m not ready to have a baby wow i i can actually feel the egg crawling its way back up not right now i’m not playing anything we’re not making a baby today no he was explicit needlessly and freakishly explicit well there is a genetic component but that doesn’t guarantee anything hey you’re talking about the person i love and have been avoiding for the past three hours oh man hello i don’t think so sheldon please stop trying to seduce me i thought it smelled like a petting zoo in here okay i’ve had enough it was like being hit on by rat pack peewee herman no for god’s sake you’re ridiculous that was a close one,Amy
128,bert is studying the way microbes in rocks can survive in extreme environmental conditions you know sheldon maybe if you take the time to actually read bert’s research you’d be less bitter about him winning honestly i just want you to be quiet but i’m all out of taffy sounds like the night we had coitus sheldon it’s foolish to be angry that bert’s work has merit what happened you know it’s one thing to be envious but now you’re injuring yourself it has to stop you know sheldon instead of fixating on what bert has you should appreciate all of the good things in your life you’ve got love you’re in good health you’ve got a roof over your head anybody else want to try i’m gonna go make some more tea and question my life choices really what’s up yep i can’t believe you headbutted a water fountain what about me and sheldon ever since i met penny i’ve been envious of her looks that’s why i was so happy when you cut your hair off you know what i mean you were still hot but more like a why’d that hot girl cut off all her hair hot how can you feel bad if stephen hawking says you’re brilliant way ahead of you,Amy
129,if we’re going to be staying in this apartment would you be interested in doing a little redecorating great what’d you have in mind well how about we start a little smaller like moving the furniture around look we can’t just throw away penny’s stuff but we can ask if she wants any of it back well i’m sure she misses this one i mean it’s the greatest gift i’ve ever given anybody it may have appreciated in value the artist killed himself shortly after painting that i can’t wait to see the look on her face when i give it to her again well it would be selfish of me to keep it and you to give to you so do you thank you sheldon you’re you’re being a little selfish why don’t you let leonard keep a few things i don’t think you do but all right i’ve got the neosporin who got hurt i think he might be right also who is that so no one’s gonna tell me okay,Amy
130,what’s wrong sheldon okay you can have this back in the morning i’ll put in on the list with peaches and felt what is this i love it thank you sheldon is that okay you hate scotch tape but you love scotch plaid you are a mystery i guess i guess we should stop just don’t smoke well first deliveries can be slow well should we uh head back up oh uh i don’t know sheldon you don’t want to do that do you uh well so where were we i’m sorry well shall we start over what’s wrong okay that makes sense i mean the mood’s a little different now we we don’t have to rush and the mood continues to change hold on i think i might have a little surprise that might help get things back on track no it’s not about trains stop talking about trains one second all right you can open your eyes i thought i’d let harry potter make things hotter i got a gryffindor robe for you i did am i in trouble wait what just happened sheldon do you really want to argue with me on my birthday ooh happy birthday to me is this about the baby good then you’re used to this you have got to be kidding me i understand but this is a special day for them can you just try and let it go yeah penny you’re the one who introduced him to bernie sheldon and i are living together bernadette got her doctorate we’ve all come a long way there’s a lot to be proud of how’s bernadette that’s not a real thing he’s just joking kind of hard to see the names they all look the same to me well that was quite a day i was afraid you’d be too tired,Amy
131,hi it was not a great trip i rented one of those carts pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest so while we’re at your mother’s house it might be a good time to tell her that we’re living together maybe there won’t be one well she likes me you know there’s a chance she might be okay with it thank you for cooking it looks delicious well uh howard and bernadette had their baby they haven’t said anyway we uh we also have some exciting news to share sheldon don’t overreact blah blah blah blah blah i’ll take over from here he’s been in there a long time should i go talk to him are you going to sheldon what what are you doing we’re ignoring the fins okay i don’t think that’s what she’s saying that’s exactly what she was saying well after that sheldon and i got out of the house for a while you know i’m sorry your mother made you feel bad but you know at the end of the day she was wrong because you’re not alone what about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet well let’s try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip she was gonna find out eventually sheldon i knew your mother was fine with us living together because i already told her we were this was a potential issue so i got out ahead of it and i managed the situation for you that’s right not your whole life i mean science you got that organizing your sock drawer you’re the king but understanding how other people are feeling that’s a weak spot for you have you how am i feeling right now you and i are in a relationship i help you with your shortcomings and you help me with mine delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all do you need help like the pirate who helps the other pirates connect to the internet really you’re never gonna touch their baby sheldon that was fun thank you,Amy
132,penny is it weird that we’re having girls’ night here but you don’t live here any more so it’s basically my girls’ night but now you’re thinking about it and it bothers you i get that better than ever he asks about my day takes an interest in my life he’s like my boyfriend in college except he’s real so people can see him well sheldon always has his pants on i don’t think i could pick his knees out of a lineup uh penny i don’t know how to say this but this is my first girls’ night and you’re kind of bumming everybody out i’ll call you when we get to the hotel i will bring them home so you can show me how godzilla takes a shower uhhuh bye sheldon bye bye i’ll miss you i’ll miss you more if you miss me x plus one i’ll miss you open paren x plus one close paren to the second… sheldon walked on my back two weeks ago but that was just ’cause there was a spider on his pillow and he was trying to get away i don’t know the protocol are you gonna be naked for your massage hmm then this is probably too many clothes nice to see you too sheldon why don’t we give them some privacy uhhuh it’s there on purpose it’s refreshing it’s in our agreement i have to laugh i remember signing our first relationship agreement right right got it,Amy
133,sheldon what did you do i’m sure it’s extremely frustrating and also a little sad what do you think it’s amazing a machine can do that all right now i’m gonna look at some pictures to prompt an emotional response and we’ll see if the machine can identify them accurately okay i’m looking at the first picture yes i’m looking at puppi okay what does it say i’m feeling yes i’m looking at a picture of my grandma yes what’s that are you working on your resume stop enjoying their fight come on sheldon let’s go i think it loses its impact if we’re chatting about it sheldon dinner’s ready i made beef loaf because i know you’re uncomfortable with the nonspecificity of meat loaf sheldon hey are you okay what’s going on i’m sorry leonard and penny hurt your feelings well everybody has things that they need help with like me i can’t see without my glasses and right now you’re just a a cute pink smudge wearing a childish green smudge yes you are there have definitely been days when i was sad and you could tell no see right there you knew you hurt my feelings and i’m proud of you for reasons i’m sure have something to do with my father and if you don’t like that machine get rid of it because i love you exactly the way you are it’s true pregnancy causes physiological changes in the brain that result in increased empathy,Amy
134,well he mentioned it in his mother’s eulogy so why not is there anything we can do oh all this week the early music society of pasadena is doing a joint concert with the san gabriel renaissance choir good luck people have been saying that for years hey you’re home early wow he finally used it what’d you do well i’m really happy for you i give up no i really give up can i pee now well the bra under here ain’t beige hey did you hear anything back from the caltech preschool nothing says fun like being scolded renaissance choir’s looking pretty good right now huh hey there’s another dance club nearby i mean i don’t know how you feel about latin music but according to their horas of operación they’re open you sure they’re open till dos i’m not sad i mean hello what are you sad about what feelings come on you’ve got so much to feel good about you’ve got a great job now you make more than i do it’s bigger than mine i’m not even engaged once i don’t even know if sheldon thinks about marriage i’m not getting any younger honestly i kind of thought by now we might have had some sort of… i’m sorry i can’t help it it is warm in here me too sorry i can get us there in two,Amy
135,hey sheldon i found a great restaurant for date night oh an euler’s disk fun oh immature the food here’s supposed to be great don’t fill up on chips oh look it’s bert at the bar we should go say hi because that’s what you do when you see someone you know in a public place sheldon there’s a difference between greeting a friend and following a celebrity into a bathroom hi bert oh we’re having date night oh really anybody we know that’s a real thing sorry i don’t have a list of defunct search engines that i miss oh no are you sure you don’t want to give her a few more minutes i’m so sorry fine with me sheldon that was so sweet of you so the part where he got stood up didn’t clue you in okay literally any other topic ourour first date was at a coffee shop youyou know about that were you aware of this because i’m mad at you sheldon it’s humiliating thanks to you my colleagues are gossiping about our sex life that’s why they’re doing it i’m going to bed so i’m not sleeping on the couch because you don’t know what’s private and what’s not that’s different she’s a close friend not the lady in the cafeteria who cuts the crust off your sandwiches yeah what is this are you really worried about revealing secrets to stephen hawking well i do appreciate you working on this what’s that little dot in the middle interesting you really have secrets you don’t tell me can i hear one why are they naughty please what why didn’t you say anything so when i got up at am to drive you across the desert to an antique train museum i didn’t have to,Amy

137,no sheldon we are not getting a lifesize spiderman statue for the last time no hulk no batman no lifesize statues hi well sheldon’s getting a little better with dogs he even took a picture with pluto at disneyland don’t listen to them what’s weird is that penny almost got a science fact right but you are aren’t you talk to me tell me what’s going on there are a lot of memories wrapped up in that room for me too the first time you told me you loved me was in that room and there is the love of which i speak well this isn’t an easy time for him he’s losing his apartment he’s in debt he’s probably humiliated you ready to go what’s that well a bunch of fake snakes better not spring out of it ’cause that was a lousy anniversary present no i already asked sheldon sheldon come on sheldon maybe we should just eat at our place just keep walking and don’t start thinking about it now that’s not true this isn’t about me and sheldon this is about rajesh moving in with leonard and penny you okay what’s wrong is that bothering you i mean how it relates to our relationship not the bromance between you and your brain i don’t know i just think you’re the kind of person who likes a contingency plan you need to stop hanging out with your brain so much it’s not a good influence i want to say aw but i’m gonna say ew yup we’re killin’ it,Amy
138,that’s great how so why don’t you ask me what i’m working on i’m doing some experiments to show that the signal to move a muscle occurs before you know you even decided to move it yes i’m trying to figure out to the nanometer and the attosecond precisely where and when an event of awareness takes place you know when i was six i wanted to marry the gorilla from good night gorilla maybe i was onto something you know i like harp lessons but i’m thinking of switching to elevator repair lessons what are you working on wait are you saying if we combine my experiment with your calculations we can determine the precise moment in time when the wave function collapses sheldon this is really interesting you know we’ve never collaborated professionally before are you worried it might affect our relationship well that would make me feel better that’s a ridiculous rule oh good what are they can i see that sheldon if we’re gonna have ground rules i’ll tell you the first ground rule i make the ground rules terrific do you want to hear our new set of ground rules number one we’re on the same team we’re not in competition number two disagreements can happen politely there’s no need to call an idea stupid are you listening number three to avoid getting frustrated we take builtin breaks and reward our successes with a small treat whatever you want so shall we get to work wow look at that so we’re agreed it’s complete garbage i don’t know where we went wrong well don’t give up maybe we can fix it i can hear your face talking so we’re even fine fine you want me to blow my nose here i’ll blow it better you know you’re exhausting i knew working together was a bad idea that would mean that this delayed parameter should be increased milliseconds i had a feeling you were using the wrong computational model but i didn’t say anything ’cause you’re so sensitive hey i wonder what kind of success we’d have if we defined measurement as the first moment that an action potential is seen by the visual cortex we’re finally making progress i wish we could do it without fighting i suppose it’s conceivable that the hormones associated with our fightorflight response could be sharpening our cognitive processes how dare you speak that way about my grammy and hey wait a second wait delta t could equal alpha subzero there’s only one clear choice no you bonehead revised ground rule number one we are on the same team but it is a competition revised ground rule number two there are definitely stupid questions and those who ask them can be told so right to their stupid face thanks babe number three fair topics for insult include educational pedigree scientific field intellectual prowess and mamas,Amy
139,did you say you guys are working on the guidance system tomorrow well sheldon said that he was gonna work with me on our quantum perception project well he reconfirmed with me this morning why did you tell leonard you’re working on the gyroscope tomorrow but you said you were working with me sheldon this is silly you can’t expect us to do quality work with you popping in and out like this incredible sheldon i didn’t expect that you could work on both projects but i i was wrong sheldon you’re sick go back to bed it’s okay now i don’t need butter you need sleep well i don’t want your germs around me sheldon are you okay it’s okay i’m sure we’ll find it maybe it’s wherever your pants are i can’t find it either how can he not remember a day you really can’t remember anything phones can do that you’re welcome how is it do you need anything else fine soft kitty warm kitty little ball of fur happy kitty sleepy kitty purr purr purr weiches kätzchen warmes kätzchen das nie und nimmer murrt liebes kätzchen müdes kätzchen schnurrt schnurrt schnurrt sings in mandarin,Amy

142,you know it’s nice of you to acknowledge us but this is your accomplishment where are you moving well good for you i actually have a little news myself i was uh asked to be a visiting researcher at princeton thanks but the thing is i’ll be gone for a few months and i don’t know how sheldon’s gonna feel about that you really believe that sheldon i’m so sorry yeah um raj is moving out no i’m waiting till he’s in a good mood i don’t know maybe i shouldn’t go i guess and he’ll have you and leonard right across the hall the whole time got to go morning are you feeling okay oh i’m sorry to hear that oh the more details the more sorry well maybe this’ll cheer you up i made your favorite oatmeal plain no occasion i just wanted to do something nice for you oh that’s sweet but you you did just fine on your own sheldon you’re you’re being silly you know what you need to do is put this air force project behind you and just dive into something new oh i don’t know i mean let’s say we succeed in proving that our consciousness creates reality i mean what will we have really accomplished you know a loaf of bread’s still three bucks that is true i have said that i was offered a summer research fellowship at princeton yeah that’s the one well i haven’t accepted it yet i wanted to talk to you first so are you are are you sure i don’t think plain oatmeal was the point of that story guys i don’t know sheldon’s so vulnerable right now of course i get to be part of the first team to use radon markers to map the structures that… i know but what if sheldon… hey you don’t know what goes on behind closed doors all right so you know hey you going somewhere sheldon that isn’t necessary thank you does this mean you’re okay with me going i am i wasn’t thinking that that’s a risk i’m willing to take what if we don’t fold our clothes at all my goodness that form of stimulation is highly efficient okay the car is waiting do you want to walk me downstairs is it do you think it’s possible you might enjoy being on your own for a little while i’ll love you no matter what we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it i will uhhuh i don’t know what they look like but sure i won’t got it good thinking thank you that means a lot,Amy

144,because you were driving like a lunatic it didn’t help that you couldn’t walk a straight line when the cop pulled you over yeah if you want to go off the grid you have to move out of your mother’s house howard please just call the man see what he wants okay i think we’re ready we’re here today to celebrate love not just leonard and penny’s love but the love we have for them as well as each other love is patient but it’s not gonna put up with all the side chatter so let’s knock it off howard anybody have anything snarky to say about that didn’t think so thank you all right let’s continue okay i now pronounce you husband and wife and weird other husband who came with the apartment,Bernadette
145,i’m worried about howard ever since that guy from the air force showed up he’s been a nervous wreck he won’t take any pills that aren’t chewable and shaped like a flintstone i don’t believe this this guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant no one at the office did did you tell anyone i bet it was barbara chen in retrovirus she might have heard me throwing up one morning every since she got the hearing aid she thinks she’s so great ‘cause i’m up for a major immunotherapy study and if they find out i’m pregnant they might give it to someone else i know they would they did it to barbara chen last year when i told everyone she was pregnant i had a plan i kept leaving dove bar wrappers around to explain any weight gain from all the dove bars i ate i’m pregnant try to keep up i’m sorry i have to go find out if my boss knows thanks you guys are the best i forgot my coat hey what brings you by oh how was it fell asleep i’m furious no i confronted barbara chen but she claimed she didn’t know what i was talking about it had to be barbara i’ve been trying to figure out a way to get back at her do you think using her work computer to google how to be a prostitute is over the line what kind of revenge is that this woman screwed with my job she’s got to pay why did you do that get out oh thanks you know i just wanted to get some work done without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes did you come here to bring me dinner or to gloat i’m sorry my boss wants to meet with me and i’m stressing are you kidding i’ve always been treated differently look at me listen to me i mean the first thought when you see me isn’t that’s a scientist it’s i wonder if her mommy i’ve worked so hard to get where i am and i don’t want to get sent back to square one because i’m pregnant thank you well you brought me french fries that’s a start apple slices what kind of lunatic goes to mcdonald’s and gets fruit and a chocolate shake got a minute i just wanted to apologize i know what you did was an accident for what it’s worth you’re a great liar well my boss said he hadn’t decided yet so i gently reminded him that he’s an old rich white guy and i’m a sweet little pregnant lady who’s not afraid to crying front of a jury hey i learned a long time ago when you’re four feet eleven and eye level with every guy’s crotch that’s where you punch do you know what it’s just a research project the most important job in the world is gonna be raising this child it’s all i need to give my life meaning you believe me oh good more chumps like you i’ll have the jury eating out of my hand,Bernadette
