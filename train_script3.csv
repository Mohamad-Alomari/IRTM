doc’s capital idea that’s portauprince haiti yes um is this the high iq sperm bank thankyou we’ll be right back what are you kidding you’re a semipro sheldon this was your idea a little extra money to get fractional t bandwidth in the apartment i’m sure she’ll still love him well what do you want to do okay i don’t know i’ve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before okay see you no not really i don’t care two millimetres that doesn’t seem right is that why they sent you to boarding school new neighbour significant improvement over the old neighbour hi hi we don’t mean to interrupt we live across the hall oh… uh… no… we don’t live together… um… we live together but in separate heterosexual bedrooms leonard sheldon hi hi well uh oh welcome to the building oh great great well bye bye should we have invited her for lunch we already watched the season two dvds i think we should be good neighbours invite her over make her feel welcome well then that was wrong of us we need to widen our circle yes and you’ve never met one of them i’m going to invite her over we’ll have a nice meal and chat well it’s not difficult you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response hi again hi anyway um we brought home indian food and um i know that moving can be stressful and i find that when i’m undergoing stress that good food and company can have a comforting effect also curry is a natural laxative and i don’t have to tell you that uh a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about uh yes great okay well make yourself at home you’re very welcome i have a board if you like boards this is my board what at least i didn’t have to invent twentysix dimensions just to make the math come out in what universe here we go just sit somewhere else sheldon sit well this is nice we don’t have a lot of company over yes i now but… yes i remember i’m sorry i said i’m sorry yeah it’s like regular boggle but in klingon that’s probably enough about us tell us about you i think what sheldon’s trying to say is that sagittarius wouldn’t have been our first guess wuuh do you have some sort of a job oh okay i love cheesecake i don’t eat it i just think it’s a good idea so it’s based on your life well if that was a movie i would go see it well it sounds wonderful i don’t know don’t should i say something i feel like i should say something no it’s not crazy it’s uh uh it’s a paradox and paradoxes are part of nature think about light now if you look at huygens light is a wave as confirmed by the double slit experiments but then along comes albert einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too well i didn’t make it worse our shower works no no it’s right down the hall how so that’s not true remember at thanksgiving my grandmother with alzheimer’s had that episode the worst part was watching her carve that turkey excuse me well i’m not trying to have sex with her what makes you think she wouldn’t have sex with me i’m a male and she’s a female i’m not going to engage in hypotheticals here i’m just trying to be a good neighbour that’s not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that i wouldn’t participate however briefly it’s darth vader shampoo there is a knock on the door luke skywalker’s the conditioner see what this is not a good time that’s great you guys have to go it’s just not a good time no and she’s

it sticks i’m sorry you’re welcome oh you’re going to step right okay i’ll… the hair products are sheldon’s a favour sure you can ask me a favour i would do you a favour for you oh i’ll probably say yes wow must we she asked me to do her a favour sheldon which is that’s a biological impossibility and you didn’t have to come come on you know how it is with breakups wuh i i broke up with joyce kim to mend her broken heart this situation is much less complicated there’s some kind of dispute between penny and her exboyfriend as to who gets custody of the tv she just wanted to avoid having a scene with him no sheldon there’s not going to be a scene there’s two of us and one of him i’ll do the talking hi i’m leonard this is sheldon what did i just… uh we’re here to pick up penny’s tv we’re not going to give up just like that excuse me if i were to give up at the first little hitch i never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang come on we have a combined iq of we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building just grab the door this is it knocks i’ll do the talking i’m leonard this is sheldon oh we’re scientists what i’m sorry sheldon i’m so sorry i dragged you through this and you were right about my motives i was hoping to establish a relationship with penny that might have some day led to sex anyway i’ve learned my lesson she’s out of my league i’m done with her i’ve got my work one day i’ll win the nobel prize and then i’ll die alone thank you sheldon you’re a good friend we’re home well your exboyfriend sends his regards and i think the rest is fairly selfexplanatory no it was a valid hypothesis really great our babies will be smart and beautiful is thai food okay with you penny,Leonard
1,there you go pad thai no peanuts uh i’m not sure everyone keep an eye on howard in case he starts to swell up here we go ask him for a napkin i dare you there is a knock on the door i’ll get it oh hi penny no they’re not going anywhere closes door staying in hallway so you’re coming home from work that’s great how was work so you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system yes so there’s gonna be some furniture delivered yeah no problem penny wait um if you don’t have any other plans do you want to join us for thai food and a superman movie marathon unless superman matches her speed and decelerates excuse me your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that superman’s flight is a feat of strength i have hundred comic books in there i challenge you to find a single reference to kryptonian skin cells okay her apartment’s on the fourth floor but the elevator’s broken so you’re going to have to delivery man leaves oh you’re just going to be done okay cool thanks i guess we’ll just bring it up ourselves why not we don’t need strength we’re physicists we are the intellectual descendents of archimedes give me a fulcrum and a lever and i can move the earth it’s just a matter… starts to move package i don’t have this… i don’t have this i don’t have this do you have any ideas easy easy package falls okay now we’ve got an inclined plane the force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs call it thirty degrees so about half exactly half let’s push okay see it’s moving this is easy all in the math what oh okay uh okay yeah no problem just come up here and help me pull and turn men do things for women without expecting sex i’m doing this to be a good neighbour in any case there’s no way it could lower the odds almost there almost there almost there lets go of package it starts to slip down you okay so penny’s a little messy did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort organise and label the entire world around them well they don’t hard as it may be for you to believe most people don’t sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content come on we should go what are you doing sheldon this is not your home when the transvestite lived here you didn’t care how he kept the place what were you doing in his closet oh hey penny this just arrived we just brought this up just now no no well we’ll get out of your hair it’s a joke yeah he didn’t tell it right sheldon sheldon hello sheldon are you insane you can’t just break into a woman’s apartment in the middle of the night and clean do you realise that if penny wakes up there is no reasonable explanation as to why we’re here no no you gave me an explanation it’s reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers sheldon we have to get out of here what that’s ridiculous penny snores again fine i accept your premise now please let’s go ooooh collapses against wall oh what the hell morning i’m not surprised a well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbour’s apartment and clean you think you know what you’ve convinced me maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet yes for god’s sake sheldon do i have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time i open my mouth no i do not have a sarcasm sign penny’s up how did she know it was us god this is going to be bad yes but only to clean i’m very very sorry oh yes we discussed it at length last night okay look no penny i think what you’re feeling is perfectly valid and maybe a little bit later today when you’re feeling a little bit less for lack of a better word violated maybe we could talk about this some more sure that’s another way to go you are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise sheldon laughs what’s funny no it’s fine you win what did she say is she still mad at me oh um here’s the thing reads from note penny just as oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb so too i regret my participation in what was at the very least an error in judgement the hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise one’s mistakes some mistakes such as madame curie’s discovery of radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow painful death from radiation poisoning another example from the field of ebola research… yeah six two inch dowels one package phillips head screws no please we insist it’s the least we can do considering what it is an inefficient design for example penny has a flat screen tv which means all the space behind it is wasted and control it how also inefficient and might be loud oh really show me where we put a drip tray a sluice and an overflow reservoir oh i’ve got it how about if we replace panels a b and f and crossbar h with aircraft grade aluminium meet back here in an hour got it they all leave,Leonard
2,don’t panic this is what the last hours have been about warriors unsheathe your weapons magic wielders raise your wands stay in formation that’s alright my tail’s prehensile i’ll swat him off raj no it’s a trap they’re flanking us forget the sword sheldon help raj dammit man we’re dying here the bastard teleported you betrayed us for money who are you no i can’t look at you or your avatar right now excuse me oh right right right right right penny the mailman did it again he… looks up to see penny kissing a hunky man oh sorry not much bro uh yeah uh i just i got your mail again here oh no that’s probably not such a good idea civil servants have a documented propensity to you know snap no problem bye oh and bye bro returns to apartment no i’m fine penny’s fine the guy she’s kissing is really fine and… what is wrong with you no i’m not jealous i’m just a little concerned for her i didn’t like the look of the guy that she was with yeah he was kinda dreamy well i’m done with penny i’m going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed i don’t know olivia geiger yeah so look howard if i were to ask lesley winkle out it would just be for dinner i’m not going to walk into the lab ask her to strip naked and dance for me hello lesley lesley i would like to propose an experiment right lesley i would like to propose an experiment pfff i’ve done it about two seconds for minestrone anyway i was thinking more of a biosocial exploration with a neurochemical overlay i was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleaguefriendship paradigm with the addition of a datelike component but we don’t need to quibble over terminology there is a generally accepted pattern in this area i would pick you up take you to a restaurant then we would see a movie probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of hugh grant or sandra bullock heartrate pheromones etc yes you mean kiss you now can you define the parameters of the kiss thank you takes mint shall i count down from three you proposed the experiment i think you should present your findings first none ah well thank you for your time none at all hey what’s going on oh we tried kissing but the earth didn’t move i mean any more than the miles that it was going to move anyway you don’t know me you don’t wear my chains… god that’s a good song i know what you’re thinking i’ve taken your asthma into account there’s a feline geneticist in san diego who has developed the cutest little hypoallergenic calicos i’ve been thinking about names i’m kind of torn between einstein newton and sergeant fuzzyboots maybe if it’s a cute little cuddly cat it doesn’t matter the woman’s not interested in me the woman rejected me you’re right i didn’t ask her out i should ask her out no but you’re right i should march over there and ask her out good afternoon penny so hi hey uh… i was wondering if you had plans for dinner there is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed so to clarify here by dinner i mean supper or dinner i was thinking six thirty if you can go or a different time really great us guys they… might all be there or a subset of them might be there uh algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns for example sheldon had quizznos for lunch sometimes he finds that filling other times he doesn’t it’s no fault of quizznos they have a varied menu great did we say a time and that’s still good for you cos it’s not carved in stone i’ll get my chisel to… carve the… okay i’ll see you six thirty how do i look can you tell i’m perspiring a little six thirty is it too much by the way if it should ever come up you didn’t join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at quizznos no reason oh you know what maybe this isn’t such a good idea you’re right alcohol poor judgement it could go well you could have stopped at “it could go well” i mean i’m a perfectly nice guy there’s no reason we couldn’t go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner maybe take a walk afterwards talk about things we have in common “you love pottery i love pottery” you know there’s a pause we both know what’s happening i lean in we kiss it’s a little tentative at first but then i realise she’s kissing me back and she’s biting my lower lip you know she wants me this thing is going the distance we’re going to have sex oh god oh my god i’m having a panic attack if i could calm down i wouldn’t be having a panic attack that’s why they call it a panic attack why okay what oh who am i kidding i can’t go through with this you need to call her and cancel yes i don’t know tell her i’m sick not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me but nothing so critical that she’ll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if i want to try this again give me the phone i can’t because if i don’t show up she’ll still be expecting you stop asking me all these questions i need to take another shower oh yeah no turns out that raj and howard had to work and sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn’t quite bounced back yet you’re kidding well then that’s something we have in common we both have people in our lives who… want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud nothing well with the exception of string theory not much has happened since the ’s and you can’t prove string theory at best you can say “hey look my idea has an internal logical consistency” what’s new at the cheesecake factory good good and what about your uh hallway friend no waves her away you were saying but… just say the but thing about doug and then i’ll get her back ugh don’t get me started on rebound sex i’m not sure that i do um is that one thirtysix hour experience or is it thirty six hours spread out over say one… glorious summer well chafing right of course yeah emotional chafing hey do you want to see something cool penny nods i can make this olive go into this glass without touching it physics he places the glass over the olive and spins it until the olive gets caught up on the side actually it’s centripetal force which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive the olive drops excuse me leonard disappears under tablenow if you were riding on the olive you’d be in a noninertial reference frame and would he bangs his head on the underside of the table yeah i’m okay did you spill ketchup i’m not okay no no i’m okay it’s stopped bleeding yes but i get car sick too so… sorry about your car by the way the poor guy on the bike i had a nice time yeah this no no of course not this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didn’t show up because of work and a colonoscopy when i take a girl out on a date and i do she knows she’s been dated capital d bold face underline like dayted i think i might have a little concussion i’m going to go lay down for a while good night awesome,Leonard
3,why did you hit a roadblock with invisibility interesting sounds like a breakthrough should i call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover exiting the apartment then i guess congratulations are in order i know i’m familiar with you yes i was there what well then we’ll avoid finkleday we’ll meet the new department head congratulate him shake his hand and go mahalo’s a nice touch interesting you should lead with that you don’t have buffets in india what sees howard entering with a statuesque blonde howard brought a date here comes our new boss be polite well you did call him a glorified highschool science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts morning you’re making eggs for breakfast huh cos it looks a lot like breakfast sounds yummy i look forward to your work with bacon you know i’m sure if you just apologised to gablehauser he would give you your job back okay i’ll let you get back to fixing your eggs and we all thank you hey i just ran into penny she seemed upset about something what’s with the fish what happened to your scrambled egg research so… fish fish nightlights mum’s the word sheldon are you sure you don’t want to just apologise to gablehauser and get your job back like luminous fish right… i didn’t… thank you for coming on such short notice i didn’t know what else to do he’s lost all focus every day he’s got a new obsession they enter the apartment sheldon is weaving on a loom he is wrapped in a poncho this is a particularly disturbing one because one of the great minds of the twentyfirst century is raising glowinthedark fish and weaving sarapes really when was the last time you left the house that was three weeks ago where are you going oh i see sheldon your mum made dinner that is a lovely story um are we going to do anything about sheldon sounds like a wise man a death ray no we’re not we’re not not a couple two singles like those individually wrapped slices of cheese that… are friends this is ridiculous dammit sheldon snap out of it you’re a physicist you belong at the university doing research not hiding in your room sheldon scuttles away really that’s impressive hey how did it go really what happened that narrows it down,Leonard
4,no no no no orcs are magic superman is vulnerable to magic not to mention you already lost godzilla to the illinois cavalry and hulk and orcs just get a hamburger you like hamburgers i’m sorry give him a hamburger make it two hey lesley lesley this is penny she lives across the hall from sheldon and me lesley and i do research together at the university what happened to elliot wong yeah sure why not why at my place yeah my parents felt that naming me leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn’t getting me beaten up enough lesley no nooh what are you kidding thank you sheldon what did penny mean you’d make a cute couple if penny didn’t know that lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she penny thought that i should her lesley out indicating that she penny had no interest in me asking her penny out but because she did know that i had asked lesley out and that she lesley had turned me down then she penny could be offering consolation that’s too bad you would have made a cute couple but while thinking good leonard remains available how so well what do you think thank you that was fun lesley thanks for including me uh sure why not really i thought you weren’t interested in me you mean my cello no kidding gee uh… penny what about her well i did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils so i guess there’s no point in bringing it up no no there’s nothing going on between penny and me yeah yeah i guess i am yeah yeah it is good did you want to start now oh okay a little musical foreplay terrific i’m good i’m good to go hey what’s the matter are you sure oh yeah but doesn’t that fix the problem you’ve been having thank you i’ll see you at work you can stare at your board all day sheldon she’s still going to be right oh hi pretty good pretty very there’s really no objective scale for delineating variations of good why do you ask sheldon wuh i don’t… ththththat’s really two different questions uh i’m not… sheldon we have to go thank you what did she mean she’s happy for me is she happy because i’m seeing someone or is she happy because she thinks that i’m happy because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy you know because the second person though happy is now romantically unavailable to the first person you know what i’m being ridiculous but who cares what penny thinks lesley is a terrific girl she’s attractive we like each other she’s extremely intelligent she fixed your equation you don’t believe in luck regardless i have a chance at a real relationship with lesley i’m not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy yeah hey lesley brrrr why are you smashing a flash frozen banana so anyway puts arms around her hello just extending the intimacy do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower i’m not sure but i think i’m about to discover how the banana felt who wouldn’t yeah well i’m just glad to be a part of it so what happens now oh okay thank you you want to make plans for new years sorry doctor what wha… how did it get on the internet well how did you know about it well that part’s true no kidding your old tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted really oh to be honest i don’t think it’s going to work out well what did she mean by that was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention are you even listening to me okay then you know you can grow the ingredients for soup sheldon nods,Leonard
5,oh come on some battles you win some battles you lose i think we have to acknowledge those were some fairly savage preadolescent jews sheldon let it go you hid behind a tree yelling “get the kid in the yarmulkah get the kid in the yarmulkah” hello penny a party yeah i don’t know penny… we’re really more… but thanks thanks for thinking of us is there a theme he’s asking if we can come as anyone from sciencefiction fantasy… i’ll get it he enters wearing a flash costume opens door oh no we all have other costumes we can change okay how about this nobody gets to be the flash we all change agreed i call frodo you went with thor hey sheldon there’s something i want to talk to you about before we go to the party no it’s not… terrific um this party is my first chance for penny to see me in the context of her social group and i need you not to embarrass me tonight for example tonight noone needs to know that my middle name is leakey all i’m saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for penny to see me as a member of her peer group a potential close friend and… perhaps more i don’t want to look like a dork hey sorry we’re late actually penny he’s rob… oh he’s the doppler effect okay we’re socialising meeting new people she’s not catwoman she’s just a generic cat where do you get this stuff i want to get to know penny’s friends i just i don’t know how to talk to these people how so go on then what happens this is ridiculous i’m jumping in no you’re coming with me come on yes but i need a wingman hi why don’t you just tell people you’re a zebra because i’m frodo oh no that’s penny’s exboyfriend if he were any bigger he’d have moons orbiting him why should we leave for all we know he crashed the party and penny doesn’t even want him here penny and kurt hug maybe they just want to be friends then he and i are on equal ground look if this was years ago by virtue of his size and strength kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners yes but our society has undergone a paradigm shift in the information age sheldon you and i are the alpha males we shouldn’t have to back down no i’m going to assert my dominance face to face hello penny hello kurt no i’m a hobbit uh a hobbit is a mortal halfling inhabitant of middle earth whereas an elf is an immortal tall warrior i think we’re all talking to penny here okay i understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me i mean you can’t compete with me on an intellectual level and so you’re driven to animalistic puffery no i said animalistic of course we’re all animals but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree no penny it’s okay i can handle this i’m not a dwarf i’m a hobbit a hobbit are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from shortterm to longterm memory a homohabilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what i think i’ve made my point there’s not going to be a confrontation in fact i doubt if he can even spell confrontation yeah no i’m fine it’s good it’s a good party thanks for having us it’s just getting a little late so… what’s that no good night sheldon hi penny i’m fine it’s not your fault so why was he at your party there there nothing you’re perfect yes you are penny how much have you had to drink tonight are you sure that your being drunk and your being angry with kurt doesn’t have something to do with what’s going on here yeah i’m a frickin’ genius because if all guys were like me the human race couldn’t survive probably that’s right you saw what you saw that’s how we roll in the shire closes door quickly locks and chains it,Leonard

65,no seriously i think i’ve finally figured out my problem with women what does that have to do with me and women my problem is i don’t project confidence so i decided that the next time i meet a woman i think is attractive rather than holding back and being cautious i’m going to assume the mantle of selfassurance hi i’m leonard and you are beautiful you pop sparkle and buzz electric i’m going to pick you up at eight show you a night you will never forget congratulations howard why not don’t be ridiculous raj you’re here legally fine sheldon tell us about your giant rodents so when howard said the fbi would be contacting me i was expecting mulder glad to see i got scully mulder and scully xfiles the truth is out there never mind uh so what would you like to know yes of course we’re in different departments he’s an engineer and i’m an experimental physicist you know one of those guys who examines the building blocks of creation and says hello maker of the universe i see what you did there good one good it’s a good relationship of course most of my relationships are good probably because i exude confidence people are drawn to that you know confidence not exuding you are beautiful you know that you pop sparkle and buzz electric i’m going to pick you up at eight show you a night you will never forget really is that oh my i didn’t see the ring with my glasses off so look at that i’m starting to exude want to get that could you get that would you please get that what happened and i may have hit on her a little bit i feel awful to tell you the truth i thought if anyone was going to screw things up for howard it’d be sheldon what are you doing up really maybe sleep has met you before i’m sorry why can’t you sleep did something happen today that’s bothering you what because you feel guilty actually you don’t have insomnia you’re sleeping now you’re having a guiltridden dream how about that gorn sitting on the couch hey seconds,Leonard

70,i had a great idea you know how we’re always having to stop and solve differential equations like when you’re doing fourier analysis or using the schrodinger equation i was thinking we could write a little app that would use handwriting recognition and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine you just use your smartphone take a picture of the equation and bam can you say that and not make it sound like i’m a cat who learned how to use the toilet oh yay for me what about you guys i can’t promise anything but people do make money off stuff like this i was thinking we could work on this at night and then maybe in a couple of weeks we’ll have ourselves an app to sell yeah i checked the app store no one is doing handwritingrecognition differential equation solving what she’s not going to steal our idea we’re gonna write an application… it’s not boring at all you see in higher order mathematics there are certain sets of equations that… satisfied that is ridiculous okay we need to stop for a minute sheldon you’re not in charge it’s my idea i’m in charge well yes and you’re listed as chief executive officer chief financial officer and chief operating officer okay you need to get clear on this right now i am in charge of this project thank you i thought we might start by talking about the user interface so this button here will allow you to scan a new equation but over here you can press this and just substitute new values for the coefficients what it’s not a joke it’s the real design sheldon i think this will work let’s just try it my way are you done we’re not doing names now howard no that’s just sheldon backwards we’re not wasting time with names right now no no oh sheldon stop it that’s enough sheldon okay that’s it you’re fired because you’re impossible to work with what are you doing but i fired you no you are now nothing you have no connection to this project whatsoever i don’t want it better i want it my way what the hell are bus pants look i’m still happy to drive you to work nothing’s changed in that regard we’re still roommates we’re still friends you know what go put on your bus pants hold on that’s it we’re actually scanning equations and getting good results howard did you solve the install time problem yet what are you doing no i mean what are you doing with a theremin sheldon we’re working here no that was completely called for we need quiet well seeing as your project is to sabotage my project yes i’m telling you the lenwoloppali differential equation scanner meets a real need we’ve got a hit what’s he doing in your apartment why do you regret uh never mind stupid question we’re not playing this is real work then i guess we would let him back on the app team and while we’re doing that you could take an aerial tour of la on your flying pig okay now that you’re back on the team let’s get you caught up thank you so as you can see not only can you store your favourite equations but you can forward them to your friends or post them on facebook right from the app thanks,Leonard
71,it’s an annual science conference we’ve all been invited to speak i think her weekend just opened up pretty much except we keep our shirts on in the sauna don’t worry just sit next to me during the quiz and you can copy my answers they’re bigger than mine i can vouch for that not you him although yours was an eyeopener yeah hi listen i just got a text from raj he wanted me to tell you that when howard says nap he means sex are you an element in the actinoid series it was a latenight vote we were all exhausted and he was threatening to filibuster it’s not technically road trip god it’s travel supervisor shhshhshhshh sheldon’s asleep what’s going on what uh sure so how do you wanna do this yeah it is a little like getting into dracula’s coffin okay when you say make the best of it right so we’ll just call the middle here the neutral zone star trek you know the neutral zone between the federation and the romulan empire of course sometimes the federation and the romulans would enter the neutral zone to negotiate a temporary truce got it got it we can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up you know good night no no sure no problem true dat i’ve gotten a lot more street since we broke up no no i understand i got too intense you had to back off i’ve gotten a lot better at that you know i’ve dated four different women since we broke up and i didn’t tell any of them that i loved them and wanted to have their babies okay good night penny’s here raj whispers to him no we don’t want to watch bridget jones’s diary i’d like to kick your little brown ass oh i don’t know maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed no sure no why do you ask,Leonard

133,we had that idea years ago how come we never did anything with it that’s not what happened penny is not the reason i didn’t pursue that idea i think someone owes me an apology well maybe we have lost our focus then we’ll go to a hotel fine then we’ll just stay here and do it you would go to a beach house hey so the guys and i are talking about having kind of a science retreat this weekend i just wanted to know if that’s okay you and i had talked about going to brunch on sunday they seem okay with it hey okay let’s focus the girls are gone we have hours there are no distractions let’s change the world guys in seconds we went from let’s change the world to let’s watch tv i i think i still have it ah here it is whoa i haven’t looked at these in years robot girlfriend robot prostitute okay let’s just skip all the inventions you can have sex with all right no here we go ergonomic heated seat cushion you know let’s just come up with something new how cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality well it’s it’s possible at absolute zero but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions what do you mean had will have placed okay so it wasn’t until his st birthday that biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions that’s when he altered the timeline wait is brought right i don’t know you did it to me guys guys what are we doing we sent the girls away so we could focus all right so i’ve been thinking about the hover boards and maybe there’s a way we could use maglev technology i’m sure mrs florida’s walking funny can we get back to work some psychologists perform operant conditioning with punishment maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying off topic if only we had one okay so we agree whenever someone takes us off topic they get their arm hair yanked off all right now one benefit of quantum coupling… i think it’ll be pretty clear if not we’ll take a vote oh and also… we didn’t have to that was clearly a tangent now come on back to work if we’re leaning towards quantum coupling… aah why thank you and now i owe you one everyone stop this was a stupid idea negative reinforcement isn’t working no look we keep procrastinating we saw back to the future ii pigeons playing pingpong a bunch of countries that look like genitals and one guy whose genitals look like denmark it’s late we’ve wasted hours can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight so you’re you’re saying we should stand here in my lab on a saturday night and watch the rest of ghostbusters on a crappy laptop it really does hold up,Leonard

140,absolutely what happened what that’s great guys that’s amazing so it it’s just flirting uh no reason i just think it’s sexier when things are left to the imagination is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue it’s a joke no do you i take it back that was funny i bet that bit killed at the chuckle hut you know i think we’re zeroing in on your problem are you set on people laughing with you ‘cause if you’re cool with at you… i’m so proud of you i know but you’re going to be a tv star and you haven’t left me yet that takes guts what’s wrong oh penny i’m i’m sorry how you doing you still got the part that’s a huge accomplishment honey you only had like three lines that wasn’t gonna happen anyway oh come on no that’s not what i meant i don’t look you know words don’t always have to mean things nope uh uh i might not know what i meant but i know that i didn’t mean that not this guy oh no way right yes honestly i don’t i don’t know i got all confused when you said honestly look do i think that you are talented and that you are beautiful of course i do but isn’t los angeles full of actresses who are just as talented just as beautiful all right look we’ll come back to that that is not what i said look i think you’re really good i truly do but this is an incredibly hard thing that you’re shooting for i mean the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one should’ve let sheldon come hey can we talk that was really crappy of me what you’re trying to do is hard but people do make it and i really do believe you could be one of them and to show you how much i believe in you i kind of got you an audition the new star wars movie there’s this thing online you put yourself on tape and just send it in anyone can do it so even if it is you have a huge advantage because you’re an actual actress most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds wolowitz sent his in two days ago look maybe it is a long shot but sometimes long shots happen luke skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the death star he had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide but with the help of the force he… wow i can feel you hating me right now yes how much for a hundred longstemmed red roses really how much for three yeah i’ll call you back well i don’t think you called it idiotic come on it’s okay no you’re not okay listen to me this is just a minor setback well you have me what um… look you know i love you but but you’re you’re drunk and sad and feeling lost that is not what i said really not a good time penny don’t to my room no what no penny proposed and i didn’t say yes that’s a good question i don’t know because i’m afraid to know the answer that’s it you’re not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment did you just put a kick me sign on my back,Leonard
141,i know you need to let it go sheldon oh my god they’re just making you use your vacation days okay listen i don’t mean to diminish what you’re going through but i’m a little distracted right now it doesn’t i’m gonna go talk to penny hey okay look if you want to break up just say it no no no no i take it back don’t say it just just hate me but stay with me it worked for my parents oh oh okay good good so it’s cool if i cry a little yeah look i get it and i want you to know that i support whatever you want to do wow that that’s a big step so well before making any rash… and i support you no you’re on vacation do you really think there’s gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it bye no no oh sheldon stay i said stay i’m going to work do not follow me yeah i don’t know she already thinks i don’t support this so if i call it might look like i’m checking up on her of course i do she’s a great actress i’m proud she’s taking this risk you bought that great i got to call her before i forget how i said it hey oh how’s it going you taking hollywood by storm you got your job back that is great news i didn’t want to say anything but you are making the right choice to plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane and i support you oh hey how did she get you to do yoga oh how many times do i have to say it i support you fine i’m not sure you should have quit but if you care so much what i think why didn’t you ask me before you did it yes i thought we were in the kind of relationship where we make decisions together if i’m wrong then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we’re actually in can we please have some privacy no for some reason we’re planning a future where we both live with sheldon forever i swear i am on your side listen i could never do what you’re doing okay i would be terrified my point is just because i couldn’t do it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t and i’m proud of you,Leonard
142,oh i’ve got butterflies hey we’re about to buy tickets for comiccon they sell out incredibly fast but as long as one of us gets in we can buy passes… well this is it this is it this is it not yet i did it i did it i’m in the queue uh fifteen… …thousand two hundred and eleven oh thursday’s gone just sunday left sunday’s gone yeah sheldon just buy scalped tickets with us do what you want we’re getting scalped tickets the same way i know that the people in the tv set can’t see me did you tell them that you’re holding your convention at a marie callender’s and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie look even your friend wil wheaton thinks this is a waste of time sheldon buddy i just don’t think this is going to come together for you good luck mmm what if we go as the fantastic four and just tell people that the invisible girl is standing there with us does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape sheldon i don’t care if you get scalped tickets with us or not but please don’t be creepy and go stalking this poor guy you’re gonna get in trouble yes he he’s late because he’s on his way here from well now you’re making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location maybe this isn’t a good idea hold on we always do this chicken out we’re we’re so afraid of getting into trouble that we never do anything wrong even batman breaks the rules i say this one time instead of wimping out let’s be badasses howard you in on this name one a little good this is exciting yeah what if we do get caught who cares so we get banned from comiccon i wonder if we’d have to disclose something like this when we apply for grants,Leonard
143,plus i’m not sure it’s a great idea to take penny to where wine comes from what it’s a joke oh come on we bust on each other i wear dorky glasses you might have a problem it’s all for laughs we’d be happy to watch cinnamon okay raj i got it bye to cinnamon that was your daddy he wanted me to say that he misses… why am i doing this ooh flowers and chocolates somebody’s trying to get me out of my panties got you a little something too it gets better instead of me you can take someone who will actually enjoy it thank you seriously please don’t make me go mm don’t have to we have the whole place to ourselves in fact if you want we can do it right here on sheldon’s spot to the bedroom hey cinnamon guess who just did it human style it’s a little late but i’ll take it oh crap what are we gonna do i don’t have a vet i have a podiatrist an optometrist an allergist a dermatologist a urologist you’d think i’d have a vet okay koothrappali was right we should have let her watch well to be fair you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me no maybe to her really do you know how much those lakers tickets were sorry we’re really sorry it was an accident oh no come on it was a while it was a while maybe but you also think nine minutes isn’t a while so what do you know they’ve been in there like half an hour how long should we stay i saw a thai place next door how’s she doing yeah yes thank you for all your help oh hey you’re back how was your trip great what did you do wait wait wait wait wait wait i’m gonna need more details no hang on hang on are all those things equal to you well give it a go additional data you dog,Leonard

145,hey i mean it’s been a little tough but penny’s following her dreams and in my book that is not depressing why would you do that so are you really not gonna do this movie well but don’t a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies i don’t know anything about show business so if you think it’s reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings i’m sure you know what you’re doing no no no this is not a fight i was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you’d rather sit at home and do nothing than take it now it’s a fight are we playing individual or teams oh how’d it go at the mechanic yeah sure i’m so sorry i know it’s a sensitive subject but can you reconsider that part in the movie at least they talked about you on letterman come on i can drive you wherever you need to go you sure you want to do this let’s get this over with am i driving you to the cheesecake factory or are we having sex i’m just i’m trying to lighten the mood sorry so humiliating am i driving you to the cheesecake factory… i’m sorry i’ll i’ll stop i’ll stop come on don’t look so sad you never know what’s gonna happen maybe tonight will be great i know i thought we’d take yours it’s nothing fancy but it’ll get you to auditions and at least for now you don’t have to go back to waitressing don’t say anything i mean you could say thank you i did just buy you a car,Leonard

165,wow you remember that you know when you talk like that i want to take you right here on this table well it’s tricky working with superfluids whatever container you put them in they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own exactly except you don’t have a lunatic running around yelling i fed you sugar water why are you biting me come on this is boring you really want to talk about this okay well this is cool uh there’s a thing called superfluid vacuum theory where empty space is imagined as a superfluid with all of its qualities viscosity density surface tension… no no people don’t talk about surface tension if you imagine our threespace as the surface of an ndimensional superfluid bubble… this is exciting this is really exciting i have to go find sheldon which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negativeenergy density as spacetime so what do you think what do you think so what do you think what is it wrong have you seen it somewhere else i know this isn’t my area and i could never do the math like you can but could this be something no one told you to taste them come on is is this good or not really you do you’re not messing with me you’re giving me a sticker i’m not a preschooler i earned this back off you’re still awake you worked out all the math you wrote a paper on my idea when did my idea become our idea this is good our idea is really good you know if no one’s thought of this yet this could be a big deal wow it’s all happening so fast should we just sleep on it you’re sure it’s good okay partner let’s do it one two three well we did it is your tongue blue sheldon this is superfluid helium put this in your mouth your tongue will freeze and break off no really what’d they say let me see let me see one calls it insightful and innovative we’re insightful and innovative oh the pleasure is mine mr innovative uh another one says the concept shows some real outofthebox thinking do you hear that mr outofthe okay okay uh the analogy between spacetime and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false i wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish it’s anonymous and user name general relativity uh don’t lower yourself to their level sheldon my name’s on that paper too there’s no upside to doing this upon review i’ve changed my mind about the cooperhofstadter hypothesis that spacetime is like a superfluid in fact it’s inspired me to come up with my own theory maybe spacetime is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket much like cooper and hofstadter do it somebody else do it well maybe we shouldn’t have sunk to his level read it back one more time and you don’t think that’s too rough do you really want him to write back mewow what did you write what does that mean are you crazy you don’t know who this person is delete that oh really never noticed that about you all right do it call him let’s find out what this loser’s ever accomplished you really didn’t like our paper stephen hawking liked our paper said the premise is intriguing and you as well mr ourpremiseisintriguing you will not believe what stephen hawking just said you’re right this is even weirder than i thought are you kidding no no yeah okay i’m good,Leonard
166,no problem the place really looks great we know we know because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime why don’t we go get the food for the party mmm when really we’re just exiting an uncomfortable situation hi we’re here to pick up an order for comic center oh yeah look at that we’re not selling his tomatoes on ebay that would be great i don’t know i mean if he’s not nice it’s gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again he was a jerk because you rearended him come on sorry to bother you thank you sorry again that would be great yeah thank you that’s it that’s the line what do you think i can’t believe they did that wait sheldon gave me a banana in a box he was testing me too and how could a chimp even solve that that was impossible so you guys were testing us both what is the matter with you hey you okay what’s wrong i’m so sorry not right now sheldon buddy how are you doing stuart if you want i can yell at you later let’s have a toast to mrs wolowitz a loving mother to all of us we’ll miss you,Leonard
167,that doesn’t sound right my research has shown that it takes three to five years of shameless begging i’m telling you you can’t create love in a few hours right i’ve been listening to sheldon’s feelings on things for ten years tag you’re it in love yet well are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment yeah sure that might be fun hmm i can honestly say penny i’m in love let’s do something else okay should we call howard and bernadette what’s that ladies yup this is cool i’m putting the city names in the grid now i’m sure that’ll give us the code to the safe yup got the code which book are we looking for here it is there’s a black light i bet the key’s behind it we spent two hundred dollars on six minutes of fun,Leonard
168,i was unstoppable i mean i was i was on fire it was like my mind and my body were totally connected like like athletes must feel when they’re in the zone admit it you’re a little turned on why not hey okay okay well we’re we’re very happy for you why a turtle well congratulations who would’ve thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family hey hey listen i i have a little confession to make no i got you something for valentine’s day and i was too embarrassed to give it to you well ’cause i got it at the dirty store in sunglasses and a hat after i parked two blocks away yeah okay uh well i hope it’s fun i mean it it comes with paints and and it’s kind of creative and artistic no no we cover ourselves in body paint and then then we get on this big canvas and do our thing you’re making fun of me forget it really okay but it’s a drive the one i went to is in san diego i thought it’d be a little more just more maybe along the zaxis but x and y are looking pretty sad uh th that’s true how late did we stay up last night damn straight almost am and we weren’t even watching tv we were watching netflix like the kids do yeah you get the paint i’ll rest for to minutes and then we do this you mean this weirdly suspicious one i don’t get it there’s actually peanut brittle in… please go to mars right there right there oh god that’s it because you wouldn’t let me wear safety goggles well we did it i mean i was on fire i i was in the zone like an athlete so where do we want to hang it but it’s an expression of our love seems a shame to throw it away god i love you i love you so much,Leonard
169,yeah actually your name is on the electric bill i don’t even know what you’re talking about and i agree what’s going on did they hate it so what’s the problem sheldon really uh that that’s not necessary cooper and his team uh at least they’re talking about the theory i mean that’s what’s important that’s not helping it’s kind of a big deal can we please just stop talking about it nothing i’m fine what are we doing oh look i know shopping cheers you up but it’s just not really my thing does it have a camera in it baby’s listening what what happened did you tell him it was my idea thank you what did he say why did he think you’re the lead scientist it was my idea if you’re trying to make me feel better it’s not working no i’m the one who thought of it yeah but now he’s happy to let people think he’s responsible for everything he always needs all the attention he’s such a baby i swear he is never ever playing with my helicopter of course so stuart have you thought about what you’d do if howard sells the house subtle fine of course you’d focus on that rather than the inspiration uh new salon topic what’s more important an idea or its execution no it’s okay we’re all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion at least i am howard what do you think oh now he’s a genius all you ever do is make fun of him and engineering you’re being ridiculous lots of people also didn’t have that idea like everyone in the entire world except for me so i’m just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit you want some of this i’ll give you some right now i’m just trying to burp without throwing up,Leonard

200,so if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits if it’s unobserved it will however if it’s observed after it’s left the plane but before it hits its target it will not have gone through both slits there’s no point i just think it’s a good idea for a teeshirt i think this is the place leonard i don’t think i can do this no we are committing genetic fraud there’s no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high iq offspring think about that i have a sister with the same basic dna mix who hostesses at fuddruckers i know and i do yearn for faster downloads but there’s some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm what if she winds up with a toddler who doesn’t know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve i wouldn’t i want to leave what’s the protocol for leaving let’s try just walking out byebye are you still mad about the sperm bank you want to hear an interesting thing about stairs if the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres most people will trip no it’s true i did a series of experiments when i was twelve my father broke his clavicle no that was the result of my work with lasers evidently two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition yes she is hi hi hi great bye no we’re going to start season two of battlestar galactica not with commentary we never invited louisslashlouise over i have a very wide circle i have friends on myspace that’s the beauty of it chat we don’t chat at least not offline to what end hi leonard i’m not expert here but i believe in the context of a luncheon invitation you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements well today we tried masturbating for money actually that’s my work yeah well it’s just some quantum mechanics with a little string theory doodling around the edges that part there that’s just a joke it’s a spoof of the bourneoppenheimer approximation yeah if by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any men’s room at mit sure oh come on who hasn’t seen this differential below “here i sit broken hearted” i didn’t invent them they’re there in all of them that is the point um penny that’s where i sit no i sit there what’s the difference in the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm and yet not so close as to cause perspiration in the summer it’s directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there and there it faces the television at an angle that is neither direct thus discouraging conversation nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion i could go on but i think i’ve made my point well fine wanders in circles looking lost aaah that’s not true koothrapali and wolowitz come over all the time tuesday night we played klingon boggle until one in the morning i resent you saying we don’t have company that is an antisocial implication yes it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the sun’s apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality that’s interesting leonard can’t process corn you’re lactose intolerant what’s happening it took you four years to get through high school you no you’ll only make it worse yes yes no no well this is an interesting development it has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment point taken it has been some time since we’ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn’t want to rip our eyes out so what exactly are you trying to accomplish here that woman in there’s not going to have sex with you oh good then you won’t be disappointed yes but not of the same species oh of course do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your luke skywalker nomoretears shampoo leonard has a lady over technically that would be coitus interruptus i really think we should examine the chain of causality here event a a beautiful woman stands naked in our shower event b we drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman’s exboyfriend query on what plane of existence is there even a semirational link between these events ah yes well that may be the proximal cause of our journey but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause you think with your penis oh right yes i could have stayed behind and watched wolowitz try to hit on penny in russian arabic and farsi why can’t she get her own tv no i don’t and neither do you you did not break up with joyce kim she defected to north korea so we get to have a scene with him leonard the two of us can’t even carry a tv hello okay thanks for your time leonard the tv is in the building we’ve been denied access to the building ergo we are done my apologies what’s your plan it’s just a privilege to watch your mind at work what do you think their combined iq is good thinking i’ll just be the muscle from the intercom tell him about our iq leonard my mom bought me those pants you’re going to have to call her it’s okay it wasn’t my first pantsing and it won’t be my last well you got me out of my pants don’t think like that you’re not going to die alone and you’re certainly not going to win a nobel prize that was a valid hypothesis what is happening to you thank you you’re not done with her are you not to mention imaginary we can’t have thai food we had indian for lunch they’re both curry based cuisines they would be gastronomically redundant i can see we’re going to have to spell out everything for this girl i don’t know what your odds are in the world as a whole but as far as the population of this car goes you’re a veritable mack daddy,Sheldon
201,since it’s not bee season you can have my epinephrine you don’t need chopsticks this is thai food thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century interestingly they don’t actually put the fork in their mouth they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth you’re not swelling howard hi don’t take it personally it’s his pathology he can’t talk to women you’re kidding right you realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy oh no let’s assume that they can lois lane is falling accelerating at an initial rate of feet per second per second superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel miss lane who is now travelling at approximately miles per hour hits them and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces in what space sir in what space she’s two feet above the ground frankly if he really loved her he’d let her hit the pavement it would be a more merciful death are you listening to yourself it is well established that superman’s flight is a feat of strength it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings an ability he derives from earth’s yellow sun uh a combination of the moon’s solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of kryptonian skin cells challenge accepted tries door we’re locked out i hardly think so well we don’t have a dolly or lifting belts or any measurable upper body strength archimedes would be so proud yes but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring exactly half what’s your formula for the corner ah gravity thou art a heartless bitch you do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman yeah those are men who just had sex no we’re not no we’re not no we’re not watch your fingers watch your fingers oh god my fingers no it hurt… looking around great caesar’s ghost look at this place a little messy the mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy this is chaos excuse me explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid i’m just inferring that this is a couch because the evidence suggests the coffee table’s having a tiny garage sale no excuse me but i think we’ve both found that helpful at times hang on straightening up this is not anyone’s home this is a swirling vortex of entropy because it was immaculate i mean you open that man’s closet it was left to right evening gowns cocktail dresses then his police uniforms i helped run some cable for a webcam sucks in breath no no penny i just want you to know that you don’t have to live like this i’m here for you sssshhhh penny’s sleeping i had no choice i couldn’t sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room and just outside our living room was that hallway and immediately adjacent to that hallway was… this i just gave you a reasonable explanation don’t be ridiculous i have no peers you might want to speak in a lower register evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep so that they’ll be roused by a crying baby if you want to avoid waking her speak in a lower register no lowering his voice dramatically that’s ridiculous i am not leaving until i’m done if you have time to lean you have time to clean morning i have to say i slept splendidly granted not long but just deeply and well sarcasm granted my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox but i think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of penny’s quality of life you don’t think that crosses a line you have a sarcasm sign do you want some cereal i’m feeling so good today i’m going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf hello honey puffs i may have left a suggested organisational schematic for her bedroom closet goodbye honey puffs hello big bran really more to organise you’re not actually dirty per se and snoring and that’s probably just a sinus infection but it could be sleep apnoea you might want to see an otolaryngologist it’s a throat doctor depending on the depth that’s either a proctologist or a general surgeon leonard holds up a sign reading “sarcasm” oh penny penny just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm penny stares in disbelief then leaves well that was a little nonresponsive that wasn’t sarcasm wooh boy you are all over the place this morning knocks on penny’s door i have a masters and two phd’s i should not have to do this i am truly sorry for what happened last night i take full responsibility and i hope that it won’t colour your opinion of leonard who is not only a wonderful guy but also i hear a gentle and thorough lover penny closes door in his face i did what i could his imaginary girlfriend broke up with him check check considering what how great this place looks we could put her stereo

203,i’ve been thinking about time travel again put it on the back burner anyway it occurs to me if i ever did perfect a time machine i’d just go into the past and give it to myself thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place yeah it really takes the pressure off it’s time travel leonard i will have already done that no congratulations will have been in order you know i’m not going to enjoy this party at the last department party dr finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for minutes you know what’s interesting about caves leonard nothing how’s this pleased to meet you dr gablehouser how fortunate for you that the university has chosen to hire you despite the fact that you’ve done no original research in years and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement mahalo do you know there are only eight consonants in the hawaiian language well here’s an interesting turn of events a more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward an actual real scientist to leonard how was that i can’t believe he fired me in my defence i prefaced that by saying “with all due respect” morning this isn’t breakfast it’s an experiment i finally have the time to test my hypothesis about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins and its impact visavis taste as do i i don’t want my job back i’ve spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations before that i spent four years working on my thesis before that i was in college and before that i was in the fifth grade this is my first day off in decades and i’m going to savour it i’m not just fixing my eggs i’m fixing everyone’s eggs use new eggs there is a knock on the door oh well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence i need eggs four dozen should suffice yes and evenly distributed amongst brown white free range large extralarge and jumbo never mind you won’t get it right i’d better come with you i’m taking a sabbatical because i won’t kowtow to mediocre minds theoretical physicists do not get canned but yeah no it doesn’t not unless the two doors are connected by relays or there are motion sensors involved or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door slow down slow down please slow down look you’re not leaving yourself enough space between cars no no let me do the math for you this car weighs let’s say lb now add say for me for you oh i’m sorry did i insult you is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth interesting anyway that gives us a total weight of let’s say lb fine we’re travelling forward at good lord miles an hour now let’s assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned still by the time we come to a stop we’ll be occupying the same space as that buick in front of us an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death mutilation and… oh look they built a new putput course this is great look at me out in the real world of ordinary people just living their ordinary colourless workaday lives no thank you and thank you ordinary person hey you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes uh yes but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket no this is fun oh the thing about tomatoes and i think you’ll really enjoy this is they’re shelved with the vegetables but they’re technically a fruit isn’t it oh boy well there’s some value to taking a multivitamin but the human body can only absorb so much what you’re buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine well then you’ll want some manganese that was fun maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores are you sure there are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk for example i noticed that you purchase your tampons one month’s supply at a time well think about it it’s a product that doesn’t spoil and you’re going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years well thirty thirty five hey when did your mother go into menopause oh penny this is a natural human process and we’re talking about statistically significant savings now if you assume tampons per cycle and a day cycle are you fairly regular penny shuts door in his face okay no warehouse store but we’re still on for putput golf right i think it’s her time of the month i marked the calendar for future reference it’s an experiment oh that was a dead end scrambled eggs are as good as they’re ever going to be i read an article about japanese scientists who inserted dna from luminous jellyfish into other animals and i thought hey fish nightlights it’s a billion dollar idea shhhhh oh no no no no i’ve too much to do shhhhh that’s just the beginning i also have an idea for a bulk mailorder feminine hygiene company oh glow in the dark tampons leonard we’re going to be rich mommy you called my mother thank you i was working with luminous fish and i thought hey loom mom what are you doing here i know but why this is not a sarape this is a poncho a sarape is open at the sides a poncho is closed this is a poncho and neither is a reason to call someone’s mother i went to the market with penny well then buckle up in the next four to eight days she’s going to get very crabby yes well i’m not a child i’m a grown man capable of living my life as i see fit and i certainly don’t need someone telling on me to my mother to my room and noone’s allowed in i’m not hungry morning it’s my idea of what dna would look like in a silicon based life form what do you want mom yeah what for no i’m not going to apologise i didn’t say anything that wasn’t true why not wouldn’t have been any asskickings if that stupid death ray had worked dr gablehouser um as you know several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot when i called you an idiot and i just wanted to say that i was wrong to point it out okay i got my job back i’m not quite sure it involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me thanks mom mom is dr gablehouser going to

computer intelligence bother to create a petite hot yearold killer robot artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes buzzing noise too late i win i don’t know but if cats could sing they’d hate it too the continue up the stairs and disappear from view i don’t guess as a scientist i reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation although as i’m saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot i have a conclusion based on an observation i think i know i think that’s a week from tuesday at six you just lied to penny and you did it so casually no rapid breathing no increase in perspiration so lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath no i imagine if you were going to kill me you’d have done it a long time ago knock knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock knock leonard… i need to speak to you it’s important yes you’re right it can wait until morning never mind i clearly woke you up in the middle of a rem cycle you’re in no state to talk i’m uncomfortable having been included in your lie to penny you could have told her the truth is that a relevant factor then i suppose you could have agreed to go i would suggest something to the effect of singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you and if you disagree i’d recommend you have a cat scan to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing centre of your brain why i was not aware of that oh alright leonard when we played chess earlier you were terrific and i can’t wait to play you again goodnight knock knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock knock… i was analysing our lie and i believe we’re in danger of penny seeing through the ruse simple if she were to log on to wwwsocalphysicsgrouporgactivitiesother click on upcoming events scroll down to seminars download the pdf schedule and look for the seminar on molecular positronium well then bippidyboppidyboo our pants are metaphorically on fire well sir my trousers will not be igniting today knock knock knock knock penny knock knock knock knock penny knock knock knock knock penny door opens good morning of course i do my watch is linked to the atomic clock in boulder colorado it’s accurate to one tenth of a second but as i’m saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical remember how leonard told you we couldn’t come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium yes well he lied he lied and i’m feeling very uncomfortable about it hungry tired i’m sorry this really isn’t my strong suit to help you she was going to see through your lie eventually so i told her that you were lying to protect me hunger indigestion i’m sorry i’m really not very good at this anyway penny now believes that on friday night we’re going to participate in my cousin leopold’s drug intervention yea who most people call leo but he also answers to lee remember that it’s important details leonard the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details no i made him up i think you’d call him lee well first of all your lie was laughably transparent where mine is exquisitely convoluted while you were sleeping i was weaving an ununravelable web yes if she googles leopold houston she’ll find a facebook page an online blog depicting his descent into drug use and a desperate yet hopeful listing on eharmonycom ah because it’s in long beach and i don’t drive no of course not there’s no cousin leo there’s no intervention focus leonard we just leave the house on friday night and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing leo to go back into rehab yes but he can relapse if penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again for a noble purpose to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drugaddled first cousin which i’m assuming is embarrassing yes that’s the best part you don’t have to see i told penny that you would be embarrassed if you knew that she found out that you had lied so she’s agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force ununravelable well uh penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of rent which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium given by dr emile farminfarmian okay sure i don’t see a problem with that good for you break a leg she leaves it’s a very nice community the queen mary is docked there once the largest ocean liner in the world it’s now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner no no no leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front and even then it’s iffy knock knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock knock leonard… no that’s the least of our worries i’ve been doing some research on addiction both the biochemical and behavioural aspects and i think there’s a problem with the current version of our lie sadly it’s not substance abuse is a lifelong struggle but beyond that i have realised that the leo i described would not have agreed to go to rehab because leo is a middle child you didn’t read the bio did you he’s not just a middle child he’s the quintessential middle child from a broken home to boot psychologically speaking the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of selfdestruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab great what is it fine he leaves a moment later he comes back i’ve hesitated to point this out but i must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit i’m just trying to clean up after your mess leonard throws a glass ornament at him he just manages to shut the door in time we’ll talk in the morning excuse me we just went over this as the quintessential middle child your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention for your information this is all based on solid research stick with the character profile i wrote for you i’m sorry leonard this is toby loobenfeld he’s a research assistant in the particle physics lab but he also minored in theatre at mit well you see while leo would not have gone into rehab it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel and coming home with us no we’re going with middle child and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production subtextually of course there is a knock on the door just have fun with it opening door morning penny unfortunately we weren’t able to convince him to go to rehab but we did convince him to

211,here’s the problem with teleportation assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly you would not have actually transported the individual you would have destroyed him in one location and recreated him in another personally i would never use a transporter because the original sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new sheldon no he would be exactly the same so you see it too not bad i myself started graduate school at fourteen excuse me that is my research and it is by no means a dead end you can count on us we’re on it what the hell do you mean dead end i sense a disturbance in the force he’s not wrong alright and this is my office nope goodbye oh alright this is my desk these are my books this is my door please close it behind you goodbye keen observation goodbye leonard get him out you think i haven’t considered it you really think i haven’t considered it get him out leonard yes in fact i am the youngest person ever to win it fourteen and a half uhuhuh fifteen years old dennis kim is fifteen years old and he’s already correcting my work today i went from being wolfgang amadeus mozart to… you know that other guy oh god now even you’re smarter than me why waste food in texas when a cow goes dry they don’t keep feeding it they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes yes but i assumed i would have been dead hundreds of years and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg well of course you don’t you’ve never excelled at anything yes that’s what a rational person does when his entire life’s work is invalidated by a postpubescent asian wunderkind he ceases his fruitless efforts he donates his body to scientific research and he waits to die hey i’ve decided you’re right my career is not over but since the arrival of dennis kim has rendered my research pointless i just have to find something else to focus on so i’ve decided i’m going to collaborate with you what exactly is it you do i know you chatter on about it all the time but i’ve never really paid attention oh sure you do now see what’s this here in the schematic is that a laser array no hmmm what happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon are you sure pretty sure’s not very scientific is this how you normally work just hunches and guesses and stuff alright if you’re concerned about sharing credit with me you’re name can go first… i’m going so this is engineering huh engineering where the noble semiskilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream hello oompahloompahs of science i just came by to say hello well up until now i’ve had better things to do so what are we making today really how does it work uh huh so it’s a shelf now i notice you’re using titanium did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes they’re lighter cheaper and half twice the tensile strength and you also have a note from your mother that says i love you bubbula but neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes yes did leonard tell you to say that huh it can’t be a coincidence there must be some causal link i’m missing curiouser and curiouser oh good you’re all here look i’ve decided that if the three of you drop whatever it is you’re working on and join me we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade twelve years tops they stare at him go away they nod hmm could it be me no no please come in yeah i think you’ll appreciate this very exciting something remarkable since my prospects for the nobel prize in physics have disappeared thank you very much i’ve decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the nobel peace prize look i’m going to solve the middleeast crisis by building an exact replica of jerusalem in the middle of the mexican desert you know it’s like the baseball movie build it and they will come the jewish people we’ll make it nice put out a spread of course he has the oracle told us little neo was the one you can see the matrix can’t you ah lalala hava nagila they’ll come they’ll settle and i’ll win the prize… i really don’t understand your objections professor goldfarb why wouldn’t the senoran desert make a perfectly good promised land we could call it nuevo cherusalem said pharoah to moses hey howard you’re a jew if there was another wailing wall exactly like the one in jerusalem but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs would you still be able to wail at it okay it’s definitely me welcome dennis kim youngest till the cyborgs rise up don’t worry i’ve got this ladies and gentlemen honoured daughters while mr kim by virtue of his youth and naivety has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me thank you screw him he was weak,Sheldon

brain known as the amygdala while speech is centred in the much more recently developed neocortex the former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless leonard stares at him or maybe she just doesn’t want to talk i’m not aware of any social convention that requires you to intervene at all twelfth century code of chivalry not exactly current you’d also have to be knighted for that to apply howard i’m going to need another mandarin lesson i obviously didn’t make my point with those people i like tangerine chicken i’m not getting tangerine chicken actually i thought the first two renditions were far more compelling previously i felt sympathy for the leonard character now i just find him to be whiny and annoying i’d love to but i don’t have tangerine chicken show me your citrus peels gei wo kan ni jud di zi pei show me your citrus peels gei wo kan ni jud di zi pei show me your… aieee ya xia si wo le a second what pair of underwear why me why not koothrappali or wolowitz yes i suppose he is not necessarily i’m often surprised by my lack of familiarity with leonard just the other day i discovered he not only has a loofah he hides it why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah i myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally but i don’t condemn those who seek to accelerate the process time shift and until recently i had no idea that despite his lactose intolerance he can tolerate small amounts of nonfat ice cream without producing a noxious gas that i maintain in the right concentration could be weaponised begins to unlock apartment door we’re not done ach why not we’re already through the looking glass anyway well he didn’t actually say anything but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in fantasia oh i wish it were that simple you see i don’t spend much time here and so i’ve never really chosen a place to sit there are a number of options and i’m really not familiar enough with the cushion densities air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice no no that’s crazy you go ahead and talk while i figure it out a little crush well i suppose so in the same way menelaus had a little crush on helen of troy well menelaus was the brother of agamemnon… leonard isn’t the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees the last one worked out well for koothrappali he got a free ipod oh glare i would not say that noone would say that a light year is a unit of distance not time draft you see people hear the word year and they think duration foot pound has the same problem that’s a unit of work not of weight it’s a common mistake okay i think this will be my seat well let’s see we might consider schrodinger’s cat no that’s mrs grossinger and she doesn’t have a cat she has a mexican hairless annoying little animal yip yip yip yip… sorry you diverted me anyway in erwin schrodinger in an attempt to explain the copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time now since noone knows when or if the poison has been released until the box is opened the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead well of course you don’t get it i haven’t made it yet you’d have to be psychic to get it and there’s no such thing as psychic just like schrodinger’s cat your potential relationship with leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad it is only by opening the box that you’ll find out which it is no no no no no no let me start again in erwin schrodinger… chong sho sha pwe caption translates to “long live concrete” xie xie thank you i can see that unless you’re planning on running a marathon choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy a mistake involving penny okay you’ll have to narrow it down then don’t other people might be interested i assumed you would ah then your meal choice is appropriate starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion you also made a common grammatical mistake you said nauseous when you meant nauseated but go on well if we accept your premise and also accept the highly improbable assumption that penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely bitter old man with no progeny the image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from scooby doo cartoons comes to mind alright what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion schrodinger’s cat you sound surprised mmm hou zi shui zai li du your monkey sleeps inside me show me your mucus your mucus this is not a tangerine bicycle no don’t call the library show me your mucus leonard and penny are

go so far as to forbid it well i assume you’re not referring to digestive regularity because i’ve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate oh well a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a phd in french literature well for one thing she was french for another it was literature that depends do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics do you speak klingon do you know any card tricks why would you lie about that you thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate yeah but you were neither you’re asking me to keep a secret well i’m sorry but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret so that i could choose whether or not i wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping you can’t impose a secret on an ex post facto basis secret keeping is a complicated endeavour one has to be concerned not only about what one says but about facial expression autonomic reflexes when i try to deceive i myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility long pause it’s a joke it relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the bloodsucking arachnid and tic the involuntary muscular contraction i made it up myself physiologically impossible so you’re saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences interesting see one more question and perhaps i should have led with this when did we become friends ie i couldn’t become green lantern unless i was chosen by the guardians of oa but given enough startup capital and an adequate research facility i could be batman sure in a gravelly voice i’m batman see hi penny why are you asking me i have no information about your interactions with penny other than what you provided me nor do i have any method of learning such things runs away nothing you seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and penny where obviously none exists i just think you need to be careful how you phrase things sir well i might ask you the same question why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me but exist between you and penny a person to whom i barely speak his eye begins to twitch there’s no reason to bring my looks into this good day leonard i said good day he leaves you must release me from my oath why don’t you take a minute to decide leads her away i can’t

you did not hear about from me forget you want me to forget this mind does not forget i haven’t forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me it was a drizzly tuesday leonard i’m moving out there doesn’t have to be a reason not necessarily this is a classic example of munchausen’s trilemma either the reason is predicated on a series of subreasons leading to an infinite regression or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements or it’s ultimately circular ie i’m moving out because i’m moving out leonard i don’t see how i could have made it any simpler if you’ll excuse me i’m going to pack it’s my prepacked disaster evacuation bag recommended by the department of homeland security and sarah connor until i find a permanent place i will stay with friends

218,worst renaissance fair ever it was rife with historical inaccuracies for example the tavern girl serving flagons of mead now her costume was obviously germanic but in the bavarian purity laws or rhineheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead at best they would have had some sort of spiced wine ohho really well here’s another nit for you the flagons would not have been made of polypropylene bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century if anything they would have said “huzzah” renaissance fair more of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair that was not fifteenth century soap my god those people need to learn you can’t just put “ye olde” in front of anything and expect to get away with it you’re wearing modern underwear i fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen don’t be silly i borrowed one of your pillow cases notify the editors of the oxford english dictionary the word plenty has been redefined to mean two oh no her research methodology is sloppy she’s unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity and to make matters worse she’s often mean to me you’d hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension mud you know how i know we’re not in the matrix if we were the food would be better hello to you insufficiently intelligent person well if you’ll excuse me i’m going to go do work that promises significant results as opposed to what you do which does not yeah you heard me great news my mom sent me my old nintendo you know what this means don’t you break out the red bull it’s time to rock mario old school but it’s friday friday’s always vintage game night look mom included the memory card we can pick up where i left off in when i had pernicious anaemia well then no problem i have three controllers the more the merrier oh well you can’t blame me for not jumping to that conclusion well statistically speaking… leonard i am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an iq which can’t be accurately measured by normal tests how much scarcer could i be you want me to leave the apartment you mean just go someplace else and be… someplace else well why should i leave this is my apartment too well alright then playing super mario on a poorly coded nintendo emulator i’m a modern day napoleon exiled to the elba of the staircase because leonard get this has a date alone what if i choke on my popcorn who will administer the heimlich manoeuvre no popcorn at the mo… listen to yourself i don’t drink coffee what do they have pastries such as bearclaws i don’t like bearclaws leslie winkle of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world why does it have to be leslie winkle oh please the only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space everybody has a date even you mario going after princess peach and what am i doing i’m just enabling you i’m sorry to interrupt batteries dying continue don’t forget the male pattern baldness when his uncles sit around the dinner table they look like a half carton of eggs exits extension cord trails after him eventually goes tight a couple of times then falls loose i have to make peepee i’m sorry i am not going back to the renaissance fair i don’t care there are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort you mean like spock fascinating if you’re having trouble deciding where to sit may i suggest one potato two potato or as i call it the leslie winkle experimental methodology it’s not hard it’s simple you can either sit with me your friend colleague and roommate or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with penny alright let’s say i go to dinner alone and during the meal i have to use the rest room how do i know someone’s not touching my food penny hold on are you sure things can’t work out with you and leonard i’m just wondering if you really gave it the old college try or in your case the old community college try leonard is upstairs right now with my arch enemy yes the doctor doom to my mr fantastic the doctor octopus to my spiderman the doctor sivana to my captain marvel do you know it’s amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out leslie winkle penny she belittles my research she called me dumbass given this situation i have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with leonard no that response is unacceptable to me smart i’d have to lose iq points to be classified as smart i’m sorry you continue to underestimate my abilities madam wait a minute why am i doing all the giving here if leonard’s really my friend why doesn’t he have to support me in my hatred of leslie winkle oh now you’re just making stuff up oh mario if only i could control everyone the way i control you hop you little plumber hop hop hop when the two of you reach a natural stopping point i’d like to have a word leonard you are my friend and friends support their friends apparently so i am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with leslie i will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant subpar scientist who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory you kids have fun i’m listening amuse me balderdash matter clearly consists of tiny strings i hope so it was a snort of derision look on the bright side only nine more months to comiccon

you’re welcome point of inquiry why did you put your car key in the door lock well the american midwest was mostly settled by scandinavian and germanic peoples who well they have a characteristic facial bone structure… well actually insects are a dietary staple in many cultures they’re almost pure protein i believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag but returning to your key conundrum perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you and you’re frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology there there reluctantly would you prefer to wait in our apartment alright then turns to go inside again just when i think i’ve gotten the hang of sarcasm make yourself comfortable sits in sheldon’s

subatomic wild geese then i plead guilty his phone rings oh penny god no oh yeah well you wouldn’t even be nominated dr gablehauser i have a series of important multibit calculations and simulations

220,sit over there baby wipe i’ll tell you why i had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry excuse me thirty what under thirty what to watch what if i had a million guesses i never would have gotten that i’m confused was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included what people yeah but exactly who are these people what are their credentials how are they qualified what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that’s been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty in general yes oh there’s my missing neutrino you were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge weren’t you you little subatomic dickens here look look i found my missing neutrino apologise for what i sense you’re trying to tell me something oh no i beg to differ of the three of us i was by far the most supportive how will raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him when i was eleven my sister bought our father a “world’s greatest dad” coffee mug and frankly the man coasted until the day he died i had not considered that i often forget other people have limitations it’s so sad but i’m not fine what do you want me to do dr gablehauser well you didn’t discover him you merely noticed he was here much like he did with nq sub oh sorry smiles he gets a new office i can’t even get paper towels in the men’s room damn this is hard smiles aaaah right a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself leonard nudges him he smiles phone rings have we at this point met our social obligations now there’s a tribe in papua new guinea where when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin superstitious nonsense of course but one can see their point smiles i can make it but i won’t a tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward earth and he exploded it with his mind now did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded even though the menu description specifies shredded brown rice not white did you stop at the korean grocery and get the good hot mustard did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market thank you what took you so long fine opens carton shows it to leonard in disgust i want you to check before you accept the order were you distracted by the possibility that koothrappali might have intercourse with penny tonight then there’s no excuse for this chicken you know this situation with koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood that’s northwest texas i’m from east texas the gulf region home to many vietnamese shrimpers no anyway when i was eight a montgomeryward delivery van ran over our cat lucky yes lucky while others mourned lucky i realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs a faithful companion that i could snuggle with at night and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command please no nothing so pedestrian i wanted a griffin yes half eagle half lion irrelevant see i was studying recombinant dna technology and i was confident i could create one but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them my point is if koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow undeserved fame perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort that’s one option but who has the time but consider this the japanese they’re doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence now you combine that with some animatronics from the imagineers over at disney next thing you know we’re playing halo with a multilingual abraham lincoln uh for the record it could kill us to meet new people they could be murderers or the carriers of unusual pathogens and i’m not insane my mother had me tested he should share our love of technology,Sheldon
221,good morning leonard yeah we’re going to have to stop by pottery barn on the way to work i bought these star wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good night’s sleep i don’t like the way darth vader stares at me oh just because your career’s been stagnant for a few years that’s no reason to give up did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas then you can drive let’s go you did i didn’t let’s go but how am i going to get to work i can’t take the bus any more they don’t have seatbelts and they won’t let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords i didn’t try i succeeded for some reason it alarmed the other passengers and i was asked to debus don’t talk to me like i’m a child now take me to return my star wars sheets knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny… leonard’s asleep no wait you have to drive me to work but i don’t drive and i can’t take the bus penny didn’t you recently state that you and i are friends then i hereby invoke what i’m given to understand is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship the favour i’m sorry i didn’t realize i was interrupting your morning prayers when you’re done we’ll go thank you for driving me to work oh good i’m not keeping you from anything your check engine light is on typically that’s an indicator to you know check your engine well actually that would be all the more reason to you know check your engine if it were fine the light wouldn’t be on that’s why the manufacturer installed that light to let you know it’s not fine is there a “check the check engine light light” penny takes a drink of coffee ooooh studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces one’s reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol of course not you’re going up euclid avenue leonard takes los robles avenue euclid avenue is shorter as the crow flies but it has speed bumps which appreciably increase pointtopoint drive time making it the less efficient choice but you have the conn of course if you’re not going to slow down for the speed bumps i withdraw my previous objection here’s a fun question do you know what the most common street name is the answer’s tricky it’s second street you see you’d think it would be first street but in most towns first street eventually gets renamed to something else you know like main street broad street michigan avenue leonard and i often use our commute time to exercise our minds with brainteasers like that we also play games would you like to play one oh come on it’s fun ooh another bump okay i’ll say an element and uh you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one i said okay i’ll start helium now you could say mercury that would give me a y ooh very clever that’s a tough one so i go ytterbium which gets you back to m so you go molybdenum and i say magnesium you say manganese and i say europium and and you’re left with mendelevium and there are no more m’s because i believe that meitnerium should still be called ekairidium so congratulations you win do you wanna go again all right hmm huh i’m sorry i’m finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the checkengine light to be very troubling well i have to tell you that while i do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine i’m not sure i’m capable of performing diagnostics okay i’ll give it a shot gets out penny drives away oh leonard there you are i’m ready to go home good perfect timing no you said you couldn’t drive me to work this is from work now how do you propose i get home penny but i sense that’s no longer an option aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa oh god not euclid avenue

comic book day we have to go to the comic book store and then we have to stop at soup plantation it’s creamy tomato soup day and radio shack there’s a sale on triplea batteries plus we have to go to pottery barn and return my star wars sheets you want to go to pottery barn first can you drive me to pottery barn she closes the door maybe if i turn off the nightlight i can keep the sheets good morning she’s in my spot don’t look at me like that everybody knows that my spot department of motor vehicles new driver handbook but i don’t have a problem why penny hold on i have one condition we have to stop at pottery barn and radio shack and the comic book store i just don’t see why i need a driver’s license albert einstein never had a driver’s license i was otherwise engaged examining perturbative amplitudes in n supersymmetric theories leading to a reexamination of the ultraviolet properties of multiloop n supergravity using modern twistor theory i’m actually more of a theorist oh excuse me but i have some concerns about these questions yes no just look see this first question makes no sense how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving there’s no possible way to answer that a car length is not a standardized unit of measure i don’t need your help penny no no wait no hang on look at this next question how else are they going to learn look question when are roadways most slippery now okay there are three answers none of which are correct the correct answer is when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction but i’m not done i have many additional concerns about these questions aced it is that why i appear to be in downtown fallujah behind the wheel of an uparmored humvee ooh hmmmm statistically red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour i don’t want any hassles with the fuzz you know the pale blue of luke skywalker’s lightsaber before it was digitally remastered i haven’t fastened my seat belt yet click now are there air bags what if a simulated van rearends me thank

crashing and panic then animal noises remind me to compliment wolowitz on the software it’s amazingly detailed no i’m not giving up i never give up i’m transcending the situation i’m clearly too evolved for driving leonard have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size well those are indicators that i’m farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human well no no i’m not going to go so far as to say that i represent a distinct new stage in humankind you know a homo novus if you will no that’s for anthropologists to decide but i am convinced that the reason i cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because i’m not meant to no no leonard i’m meant for greater things like unraveling the mysteries of the universe not determining when it’s safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road yeah well i know that now homo novus doesn’t know good morning gentlemen you saw nothing sweeps

224,penny hello what is shaking it’s colloquial a conversation opener so do you find the weather satisfying are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team i’m striking up a casual conversation with you s’u’up all right but i’m given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone it’s more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat no oh good i used that right anyway you’re aware that leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component her name is dr stephanie barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at freemont memorial good what he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me yes see of the handful of women leonard’s been involved with she’s the only one i have ever found tolerable the statement stands for itself anyway should you have any interaction with her it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival you say that now but consider the following scenario you’re sitting in your apartment it’s late you’re alone your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate or a uh hookup as it’s referred to by today’s urban youth yes now should that happen i would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido fine whatever works uh peace out well this is very pleasant and you said there’d never be enough pasta for the three of us you know italian housewives have a rule of thumb a handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked thank you well stephanie since leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball i guess i’ll just have to pick it up have you ever witnessed a violent crime good what’s your favourite fruit hmm technically not a fruit but all right where did you do your medical internship really that’s where i was born i spent so much of my childhood at that hospital when i was i got to ride there in a helicopter radiation burns a little mishap while i was building my own cat scanner no i didn’t try i succeeded in fact i was briefly able to see the inside of my sister’s guinea pig snowball before he caught fire it led to an interesting expression in our house not a snowball’s chance in a cat scanner excuse me when i come back just for fun the subject will be alternative history specifically how would the civil war have gone differently if lincoln had been a robot sent from the future to leonard look at that there’s even pasta left over i do do you because frankly you’ve been in a foul mood since i sat down to help look if you fail at this relationship and history suggests you will then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed you’re kirk i’m spock wolowitz is scotty koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed and now we’ve got mccoy i have a bone to pick with you sir hi stephanie i’m sorry i’m late but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation we’re going to the movies what movie what theatre what time if you were trying to make it impossible to locate you you couldn’t have done a better job it took me nearly minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up wait here i’ll find us seats my apologies you’ve been sitting in it all along leonard you want to slide over one oh yeah this is it leonard knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard tell me what you see here this is stephanie’s facebook page now where it should say in a relationship what does it say yeah furthermore earlier this evening she threw a digital sheep at some guy named mike who’s mike why does he get a digital sheep and not you you don’t see it do you we’re losing her i’m afraid i can’t allow that pursuant to starfleet general order section a you are deemed unfit and i hereby relieve you of your command give me one good reason why not penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny this is banana bread it’s my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat i suppose i could spare a few minutes were you robbed how can you be sure i’m certain this will come as no surprise to you but leonard is failing in yet another relationship she’s sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet if i have any hope of keeping them together i need data specifically i need to know exactly what leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks again urban slang in which i believe i’m gaining remarkable fluency so what is the down and the low and don’t worry this is all entirely confidential so you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom because it’s not enough that you made me watch that movie but now you mock me with it gentlemen i have a question about dating and relationships more to the point it’s about finding a way to keep leonard and stephanie together well why not yes i’m aware of the math y equals days over to the nth the issue remains how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection so that’s all you’ve got apocalyptic genocide and go easy on the cologne penny knock knock knock penny penny zucchini bread may i come in i see apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and leonard crossed some sort of line i apologize so have you and i returned to a social equilibrium great new topic where are you in your menstrual cycle i’ve been doing some research online and apparently female primates you know uh apes chimpanzees you they find their mate more desirable when he’s being courted by another female now this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation which brings me back to my question where are you in penny slams door clearly i’m days too early oh hi stephanie i have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied i’m helping you with stephanie when i fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male you see when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin if the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love yes actually it would but let’s see how the lid goes i’m not strong enough leonard you’ll have to do it go ahead it’s preloosened no yeah yeah he’s got it and that’s not surprising this is something i long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male open it leonard tries again then taps jar on counter jar breaks like a gladiator fyi i was defrosting a steak in there what a beautiful job stephanie did i might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch but you can’t argue with her results it’s a shame it won’t scar the war wound is a timehonoured badge of masculinity just for the record my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears watery she’s right as long as you’re vomiting coitus is contraindicated you’re welcome dr hofstadter well you seem like a perfectly pleasant person i just can’t understand why women have such a hard time loving you i had no choice he cried in front of her oh it’s hardly hacking when you use the same

227,first off that is axiomatically wrong because the best pudding is chocolate secondly the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death it is extracted from the plant… it is extracted from the plant… tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant manihot esculenta due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly it is also indigenous to brazil as is the cocoa bean from which we get chocolate the best pudding and you promised you wouldn’t do that anymore hey it’s true kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted but he also controls the new open science grid computer that i need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe well then the solution is simple i shall befriend him kripke what’d you say of the idea of you and i becoming friends really that seems rather short sighted coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable why don’t you take some time to reconsider well i think we’re off to a terrific start hello this is sheldon cooper i’m leaving a message for barry kripke barry it was pleasant seeing you today in the cafeteria i saw that you purchased the chef’s salad apparently you did not know that the chef’s salad is kitchen trickery to utilize scrap meat nevertheless i hope you enjoyed it i’m following up on our pending friendship and i look forward to hearing from you regarding its status sheldon cooper first warning penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock pennythis is for you hi it’s a questionnaire i devised i’m having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work so i’m doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me yeah i agree the social sciences are largely hokum but short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship this is the best i can do i know i may have started off with a fairly obvious one you did an aspect of my most appealing trait playfulness why don’t you just go ahead and write that number i’m afraid you’re on your own for the rest it should take you no more than hours only don’t worry in deference to you i’ve kept them on a high school graduate reading level you got it buddy well that’s certainly a thoughtprovoking hypothesis may i suggest it as the topic for your essay your questionnaire very disappointing you answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern a b b a c a b b a c how could i not yes well it’s better than what wolowitz did he drew a raccoon with what appears to be a distended scrotum what hope do i have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me i don’t see how you could what do you mean i did learn how to swim the skills are transferrable i just have no interest in going in the water the ice caps are melting leonard in the future swimming isn’t going to be optional but you do bring up an interesting point i don’t have to break new ground here i’m sure much of the research already exists that’s insane on the face of it come on you’re driving me to the mall i’m going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking coping with the death of a loved one my condolences family or friend too bad if it’d been a friend i’m available to fill the void woman moves away it’s just as well she smelled like moth balls excuse me do you have any books about making friends i assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred oh i love trains oh my that’s awfully sticky alright let’s see bernie bunny has two daddies now it’s probably about homosexual rabbits jerry the gerbil and the bullies on the bus read it not helpful oh here we go stu the cockatoo is new at the zoo author sarah carpenter lives in fort wayne indiana with her husband and best friend mark and their cockatoos too hardly makes her an expert in making friends wouldn’t you agree me too most people don’t see it what are you reading oh i do like monkeys somewhat anthropomorphized but yes say maybe sometime you and i can go see monkeys together would you like that i’m making friends with this little girl what’s your name hi rebecca i’m your new friend sheldon we were really hitting it off oh good you’re just in time i believe i’ve isolated the algorithm for making friends see my initial approach to kripke had the same deficiencies as those that plagued stu the cockatoo when he was new at the zoo it’s a terrific book i’ve distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process hello kripke yes sheldon cooper here it occurred to me you hadn’t returned any of my calls because i hadn’t offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship perhaps the two of us might share a meal together… i see well then perhaps you’d have time for a hot beverage popular choices include tea coffee cocoa… i see no no no wait don’t hang up yet what about a recreational activity i bet we share some common interests tell me an interest of yours really on actual horses tell me another interest of yours oh no i’m sorry i have no desire to get in the water until i absolutely have to tell me another interest of yours mmhmm mmhmm it’s interesting but isn’t ventriloquism by definition a solo activity yeah tell me another interest of yours hmmm is there any chance you like monkeys what is wrong with you everybody likes monkeys hang on kripke checking changes howard has made to his flowchart a loop counter and an escape to the least objectionable activity howard that’s brilliant i’m surprised you saw that alright kripke that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable and i would like to propose that we do that together tomorrow yes i’ll pay alright goodbye alright time to learn rock climbing you know i am a fan of ventriloquism maybe you me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage he could talk while you drink this appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop no one expects to see hominids learning to use bones as weapeons hardly fear of heights is illogical fear of falling on the other hand is prudent and evolutionary what would you say is the minimum altitude i need to achieve to cement our newfound friendship little kid hominids perhaps to man who attaches him to ropes is this your entire job your parents must be so proud coming kripke okay harness seems to be secure small amount of incontinence just now but the website said that’s to be expected hey this isn’t so bad a bit like vertical swimming i am i was wrong it is a fear of heights not really i feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function that’s approaching an asymptote what part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand yeah i don’t think i can no that doesn’t seem any more likely well it’s not exactly a plan but i think i’m going to pass out hello everyone i brought my new friend barry kripke home for dinner ddd that’s where i sit oh yes i pass out all the time but it was worth it i’ve made substantial progress in bonding with kripke which brings me to an awkward moment maintaining five friendships promises to be a herculean task so i’m going to have to let one of you go leonard you are my roommate my source of transportation and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer you are safe don’t be silly howard you do not have a phd your cologne is an assault on the senses and you’re not available for video games during the jewish high holidays no you too are safe penny penny penny everything you’re saying is true but please allow me to continue raj you’re out the good question while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing how could you for a moment think that my favourite amino acid is glutamine yeah shoulda woulda coulda raj so uh kripke i was wondering if there’s any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer no but we’re friends i’m confused i was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine oh this entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility raj you’re back in he likes monkeys,Sheldon

237,oh boy i can’t comment without violating our agreement that i don’t criticize your work great restraint on my part perhaps you mean a different thing than i do when you say science you actually had it right in the first place once again you’ve fallen for one of my classic pranks bazinga well now here’s a peculiar email the president of the university wants me to meet him at his office tomorrow morning at am that’s hours away for the next minutes i’m effectively one of heisenberg’s particles i know where i am or i know how fast i’m going but i can’t know both yet how am i supposed to carry on with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard why is everybody keep telling me what time it is you the president of the university his wife their sullen teenage daughter that entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it he didn’t respond to my email his phone number is unlisted tell me what my other option was do you remember the grant proposal i submitted to the national science foundation to detect slowmoving monopoles at the magnetic north pole aw how nice well a space opened up at the last minute on the nsf expedition to the arctic circle yes in fact he was quite enthusiastic he said “frankly if i could send you tonight i would” of course not i’m a theoretical physicist a career i chose in no small part because it’s indoors but if i’m able to detect slowmoving magnetic monopoles there i will be the scientist to confirm string theory people will write books about me thirdgraders will create macaroniart dioramas depicting scenes from my life sarcasm i’m on the horns of a dilemma can you imagine me sheldon cooper at the north pole i’m not good with cold leonard how often have we had to leave a movie theatre because i got a headache from drinking the icee too fast i can’t go how can you say that the scientific opportunity of a lifetime presents itself and my best friend says don’t go listen to you how can i possibly go odd president seibert posed the exact same question it wasn’t his wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot good news gentlemen i have tentatively accepted… …the invitation to join the arctic expedition thank you but your sentiments may be premature i would like to propose that the three of you accompany me yes i’ll admit that was a concern but the fact is i’ll need a support team and the three of you are my first choice well there are others who might be more qualified but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache now i know i’m proposing an enormous undertaking so why don’t you take a few moments to discuss it i’m still within earshot you may want to wait for my door to close well gentlemen have you reached a decision excellent and just an fyi as i am the expedition’s team leader protocol dictates that be phrased fine sir but don’t worry there will be a briefing knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny i need access to the cheesecake factory’s walkin freezer no this is to train for a threemonth expedition to the magnetic north pole i don’t know how that sentence could possibly confuse you but to elaborate i’m going to the arctic circle with leonard wolowitz and koothrappali yes yes is that a yes or a no on the freezer the woman has the attention span of a gnat yes yes you were busy you were surprised all very fascinating now where do we stand on the freezer i’m sorry but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action no did she seem upset to you oh good i got it right are you upset two for two i’m on fire that feels like a bonus question i’m going to stop here while i’m ahead but i’ve had a great time alright now the purpose of this drill is to acclimate us to the use of tools in extreme temperatures such as we will face in the arctic circle right here all right team open up your practice kits as the university did not permit me to bring the actual equipment we’ll be using to the cheesecake factory because apparently i’m “ridiculous” i’ve provided substitutes which will exercise your fine motor skills leonard you will be doing a series of complex mathematical problems on a vintage casio model calculator watch i received when i won the earth science medal in rd grade treat it with respect raj you will be painting sideburns and a van dyke on a sixinch figurine of legolas the elf now remember a van dyke is a goatee without a moustache wolowitz you will be completing a series of delicate surgical procedures on the classic children’s game operation to begin with you will remove funny bone for two hundred dollars and begin adversity is to be expected continue gentlemen use your imagination innovate did han solo let luke skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of hoth no he cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up i hadn’t thought of that i guess we’re done here here drink slash eat this it’s hot chocolate with a stick of butter because in the frigid temperatures in the arctic we need to consume at least calories a day just to maintain our body weight way ahead of you that’s an “i can’t believe it’s not butter” stick that’s very unlikely mrs koothrappali if raj dies it’ll be from frostbite gangrene acute sunburn or being ripped to shreds by a fifteen hundred pound polar bear i want a cookie meemaw but meemaw just made cookies what okay leonard i know you’re concerned about disappointing me but i want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low comforting is a part of leadership it’s not a part i care for but such is my burden assuming that’s a valid reason not to go which it isn’t how do you know this did she say it what is it oh that’s clever let me see if i understand this correctly her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable all right well given that missing you is predicated on you leaving logic dictates you must leave she does have a short attention span leonard you may be right it appears that penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion of course not even in my sleepdeprived state i’ve managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks bazinga all right men we begin initial assembly and deployment of the testing equipment starting tomorrow at hours but until then you are all off duty i suggest you keep the

don’t drive well it seems we’ve reached an impasse but i could call you a cab or an ambulance all right let it never be said that sheldon lee cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress well it does seem rather ironic that for want of cent adhesive ducks we both might die in a fiery car crash i see no organizational system in here whatsoever which panties do you wear on mondays my mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident that doesn’t mean one won’t be in another especially if i’m driving okay here all right we should have you checked for a concussion all right don’t look oh well that’s understandable you may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology uh lot and his wife perseus and medusa orpheus and eurydice they always look it never ends well ok it doesn’t feel like an arm all righty for the record i should let you know this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle yes and i have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator didn’t work out well one moment according to my driver’s ed book a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is driver’s door handle is visible in the lower right corner there’s the handle oh no too far bringing it back optimized now where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror where is the passenger side mirror yes as soon as i adjust my seat whee oh dear i’m going to have to start again oh i think we’re going sufficiently fast what’s that that can’t be nothing the check engine light is on we need to find a service station all the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes mr spock did not pilot the enterprise he was the science officer and i guarantee you that if he ever saw the enterprise’s check engine light blinking he would pull the ship over immediately oh oh red light release accelerator and slowly apply the brake nailed it while we have a moment may i ask you a question why do you have the chinese character for soup tattooed on your right buttock no it isn’t but i suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup sorry as i told you the hero always peeks all right there’s no need to bark at me according to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk you’ll be seen after the man who claims to be having a heart attack but appears to be well enough to play doodle jump on his iphone we have to fill these out describe illness or injury all right and how did the accident occur cause of accident lack of adhesive ducks okay medical history have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes kidney disease migraines are you currently pregnant are you sure you look a bit puffy when was your last menstrual period i’ll put in

skin conditions soup tattoo on right buttock i’m sorry there there everything’s going to be fine sheldon’s here now remember you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer so uh don’t

precipice of forever changing mankind’s understanding of the universe aka me and here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger aka you please hold all questions to the end of the

traffic court anyway if it would please the court i’d like to begin with an opening statement very well a quick opening statement like a milking stool my case rests on three legs i will demonstrate that i was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic i will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum that which is necessary is legal but first i will raise a sixth amendment issue i’m unable to confront my accuser a nonhuman entity to wit a camera so to sum up improper instruction quod est necessarium est licitum sixth amendment my milk stool is complete thank you i object you’re completely ignoring the law really i would point out that i am at the top of my profession while you preside over the kiddy table of yours i am a scientist i never apologize for the truth that’s my spot excuse me excuse me jailor i need to use the restroom that’s the toilet please tell the judge i’m ready to apologize you know very well how it went i was found guilty and fined i also now have three points on a driver’s licence i do not yet possess and i was forced to issue an undeserved apology simply

today not finished it is because of you that i now have a criminal record and it is because of you that i missed out on having gelato with stan lee no no i will never have another chance to have gelato with stan lee because opportunities to have gelato with stan lee come but once in a lifetime the moving finger writes and having writ moves on this is stan lee’s front door we were on stan lee’s curb then we were on stan lee’s walk and now we’re at stan lee’s front door oh lord you just rang stan lee’s doorbell at stan lee’s house we’re about to go in and have milk and cookies with stan

but as you live in the same building you see each other all the time the variable which has changed is the coitus good good i’m glad we’re still friends oh yes it was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life i’d hate for that effort to have been in vain just to be clear do i have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you harsh terms but all right i’ll just substitute intercourse or fornication yeah but that has judgmental overtones so i’ll hold that in reserve well my existence is a continuum so i’ve been what i am at each point in the implied time period bazinga he seems all

hold on nope no reason all right say hello to your mother for me what i didn’t say outside no of course not that would be odd and suspicious behavior which way are you going i’m going the other way

the number of times she’s returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night before… so we multiply minus men before the loss of virginity so times gives us sexual partners let’s round that up

stars i’ve always been more of an empire man i know what your point is you’re intimidated by amy’s intellect to that i say buck up so are you suggesting i terminate my relationship with amy may i point out that for eight long months i suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her offkey country music caterwauling the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room and night after night of uninformative tv documentaries about the jersey shore yes and i’d thank you to do the same greetings i brought amy here to show her some of the work i’m doing do i detect a hint of condescension are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like clarkemaxwell or dirac you take that back excuse me but a grand unified theory insofar as it explains everything will ipso facto explain neurobiology that’s the rankest psychologism and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by gottlob frege in the s i agree i move our relationship terminate immediately there being no objections… the motion carries good day amy farrah fowler amen to that hello a breakup would imply she was my girlfriend she was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend regarding what i don’t follow penny i assure you i’m fine my relationship with amy was purely intellectual there were no emotional bonds the severing of which would cause me any discomfort the relationship simply outlived its utility and i’m continuing on with my life as before

doing here well rest assured i am in full possession of my faculties all right but you’re not fooling me whenever you say we have to talk it means you want me to listen yes ma’am that’s a peculiar conclusion by any standard amy is more similar to me than anyone i’ve ever met well whether you see it or not is irrelevant i can’t see subatomic particles but nevertheless they’re there a physics

she’s a girl she’s a friend she is not my please forgive me for doing this girlfriend leonard you are my best friend i’ve known you for seven years and i can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to amy farrah fowler i sense judgment on your part may i suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy i have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female you have none jealousy is an ugly greeneyed monster not unlike the hulk who by the way also has a girlfriend in this iteration jennifer connelly whom you may recall as the girlfriend of russell crowe in a beautiful mind a feelgood romp if there ever was one huuurgh leonard not jealous you know it just occurred to me if there are an infinite number of parallel universes in one of them there’s probably a sheldon who doesn’t believe parallel universes exist no point it’s just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle what makes you chuckle leonard is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pairbond with a woman and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity you know when my grandfather died and meemaw was alone my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people it’s very nice they discuss current events play bridge get a hot meal it is if you like bridge do you like bridge leonard meemaw resisted at first but now she loves it it’s not a home it’s a senior centre we’d never put meemaw in a home all right i’ll bow to social pressure hey no no no no thank you leonard are you sleeping are you ill are you still depressed because you’re alone and no one loves you i want you to know that i’m genuinely concerned about your wellbeing you’re welcome but it’s still no reason to have your feet in my spot since we got home from the comic bookstore as per your suggestion we’re hanging out quite frankly i don’t see what all the hoopla’s about go on amy did you know that leonard i did wise decision you see amy success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height strength attractiveness the ability to hold one’s liquor and throw darts separately or together leonard has none of these attributes right leonard oh good point amy yeah building on your premise leonard could frequent sushi bars salad bars oyster bars the apple genius bar what are you doing he does it all the time he’s a cornucopia of social awkwardness let’s make that our word of the day well i have to void my bladder it was nice spending this time with you yes i see can i get back to you on that good night closing laptop and running down stairs in panic leonard leonard leonard amy farrah fowler has asked me to

plants from invasion of the body snatchers duplicated you in every way only with an absurd amount of hair gel i’m removing my digital footprint from the internet so amy farrah fowler can’t find me and

a converted railroad dining car next stop travel town an outdoor museum featuring railroad engines cars and other rolling stock from the s to the s finally we’re off to the glitz and glamour of

that is dermatitis can i interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection very well i’m sure i can find something that will help you ditch that itch do you prefer ointment or cream with or without a numbing agent really leonard there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis prescription or nonprescription strength well i think i have a nice anamantle hc it’s usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts excellent choice priya for shame leonard for shame and to think i was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you is that really what you want to talk about leonard what do you want to talk about there it is what if someone asks perhaps but they might ask me something else like has leonard betrayed any of his friends recently in fact you did but i was referring to howard april th bob’s big boy toluca lake raj had just introduced us to priya for the first time and she was enjoying the sweet taste of hindu rebellion in the form of a bob’s super big boy hamburger in order to preserve your friendship you and howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her i had a patty melt and raj and me violation of the roommate agreement overnight guest notification clause you’re far too short to be darth vader at best you might be a turncoat ewok you mean you want me to keep a secret you know i can’t keep a secret why do you get to be batman well alfred has secrets too alfred knows that barbara gordon is batgirl which i’ve now just told to batman see i can’t keep a secret tada tada it’s short for dadadada i know that’s why i shortened it i came to go over your alibi for last night you’ve asked me to lie on your behalf and as you know i am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest so i’ve provided you with an iron clad alibi you couldn’t have spent last night with priya because you were with another woman the fun loving and morally loose miss maggie mcgeary you met her at pasadena’s most popular irish watering hole lucky baldwin’s where maggie spends her nights tending bar with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams and if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this it’s pretty convincing huh and it wasn’t even a real person and here is the clincher a lock of maggie’s flaming auburn hair from an orangutan in the primate lab well noone’s going to run a dna test on it leonard honestly you overthink everything and i have nothing to contribute to this conversation because i too know absolutely nothing about priya’s preferences in male companionship and with that i will rezip my lip oh i’ve heard of that place isn’t that pasadena’s favourite irish watering hole did you meet anyone interesting there perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid sure you can you’re doing fine it’s very believable don’t listen to him he’s still light headed from all the irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system i believe they engaged in coitus but more importantly if leonard had not abandoned his story would you have found it plausible may i point out in a parallel universe your friends are saying maggie mcgeary she sounds lovely i think a more amusing violation of raj’s trust is when howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to americans on thanksgiving well excuse me that was not a betrayal that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy for science you used my toothbrush and i’m sorry but that behaviour is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated we are no longer friends with real puffing smoke alright but i’m watching you well sure guess no you’re so close mango caterpillar what are you doing you said you liked it,Sheldon
267,the capybara is the largest member of the rodent family nothing it was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation excuse me if we’re changing topics i believe i have first dibs with capybara a rodent the size of a baby hippo you know i try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn no you squandered your time with me and the moment has now passed feast on your disappointment much as the capybara feasts on its own waste not particularly i suppose i could if i were asked of course why do you have to make things so complicated yes you say you’re special agent page fbi and here is my justice league membership card but that doesn’t prove i know batman oh all right i doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved oedipal complex for the record i truly support the fbi in the mission which is expressed through their motto correct now to business years ago i sent the fbi crime lab samples from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire on my front porch for fingerprinting and dna analysis why haven’t i heard back yet that’s of little comfort to a nation attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes a little but go on i’m going to answer that with a visual aid this is my ninedisc complete lord of the rings trilogy bluray set mr wolowitz borrowed it damaged plastic retention hub number three and then returned it to me hoping i wouldn’t notice would you characterize that as responsible you heard me say bluray right very well would you be interested in knowing that mr wolowitz once snuck onto my world of warcraft account and changed the name of a certain level warlock from sheldor to smeldor is there anything else where would you like to start he refuses to pay fines when he’s overdue with books i lend him he crashed the mars rover while attempting to impress a woman he recommended that i go see the third matrix movie because it was and i quote just as good as the first one if that’s not irresponsible i don’t know what is did i say mars rover that was actually a poorly chosen example as it had nothing to do with me i don’t want to not that my disinclination to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of howard wolowitz’s culpability in the destruction of government property worth millions of dollars oh good i was afraid you were going to fixate on that mars rover incident well your expectations have been subverted aha sleep eludes me leonard mockery that’s all you have to offer who knows i haven’t watched any scary movies recently i’m no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe and it’s been weeks since i took that accidental sip of red bull well i did mention the mars rover incident to that fbi agent and probably cost howard his security clearance but why should that keep me up interesting so you’re saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience excuse me do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis that seems fairly conclusive in his bed no gorn no that’s where i sit thank you for agreeing to see me agent page yes no i’m sorry i don’t recall you saying no backsies yes i’d like to offer a laudatory statement about howard’s many excellent qualities that i believe will tip the scales back in his favour howard joel wolowitz h is for honesty of which he has much o’s for outstanding which he is such w’s for witty he’s quick with a joke a’s for artistic his ability… but i still have rd joel wolowitz left to go i don’t understand why you people are picking on my friend howard when there are much more serious security threats to pursue for instance when i first met leonard he was on the verge of giving away rocket secrets to a north korean spy and not one agent ever investigated that no it’s a different leonard he’s chinese red hair six fingers goodbye raj have you seen howard i’m quite familiar with dr tyson he’s responsible for the demotion of pluto from planetary status i liked pluto ergo i do not like you if ifs and buts were candy and nuts we’d all have a merry christmas think about that dr tyson howard the person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me yes but before you get upset i want you to know i went to the fbi and retracted my statement no if anything i made it worse in any case i have been riddled with guilt which is causing gorninfested rem sleep so i’m here now to say i’m sorry yes i followed the social protocol i attempted to right the wrong and when i failed to do so i delivered a heartfelt apology now you say apology accepted and i will offer you a onetimeonly high five you’re tricking me it really is isn’t it oh shut up hello i have troubles penny i’ve come to pour them out to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep i don’t

rum now first dust the cherries with sugar then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters then ignite the rum caramel… that’s not how it looks in the picture all right to the metric system knocks back drink spits it all back into glass i can’t taste the cherries i wronged howard and he won’t accept my apology penny you face failure on a daily basis how do you cope to drinking knocks back drink and spits it out again nope oh if only there were some way to force howard to accept my apology so i could escape this miasma of guilt i see you’re saying i’m facing starfleet academy’s unwinnable command scenario the kobayashi maru captain kirk won impressive that you know that it’s hard to believe i’m actually having this conversation with you kirk beat the kobayashi maru by reprogramming the

felt so alive answers door oh hello alex uh let me go get you last night’s recordings well you remember when you told me i talk in my sleep well it occurred to me that like most things i say it’s probably pure gold so i started recording it all and now alex gets to comb through eight hours of what i like to call sheldon after dark jenga i win ah gentlemen what is on the conversational menu

beestung lips i want to thank you all for coming on such short notice uh in the past i’ve reached out to each of you individually but i believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group which as you can see from your commemorative tshirts i have dubbed sheldon cooper’s council of ladies i need your advice about a delicate workplace situation uh to protect those involved i’ll be changing their names well a short bespectacled colleague of mine who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate let’s call this colleague ricardo shillyshally no no shillyshally has red hair and uh he briefly served in the mexican navy anyway despite the fact that he has a girlfriend shillyshally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady no no no this is tondelaya della ventimiglia no uh no i’m sorry who’s talking about leonard and alex okay look it’s not really about ricardo and tondelaya it is really about her boss who doesn’t quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice which is surprising because dr einstein von brainstorm he’s usually pretty smart about these things ladies ladies please we’re not here to talk about penny okay we’re here to talk about me uh i mean einstein von brainstorm oh darn it all right i guess the cat’s out of the bag let me explain what’s going on ricardo is really leonard well what should

solve a serious problem you don’t know oh you poor dear your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don’t even know which way is up you made an inappropriate sexual advance towards dr hofstadter now there’s no need to get defensive i’m not unsympathetic to your plight my father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm texas day full of eggs and only appealing for a short time yeah you and me both sister now please understand i don’t hold you responsible for your behaviour because see from an evolutionary standpoint you’re a slave to your desire to reproduce but during the work day when you feel possessed by amorous intent may i suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases let’s see here oh yes check out this oozy doozy so does this fellow but he can’t without it burning like hot soup oh yes yeah and a fat lot of good it did me all she did was get mad at you i needed advice about a woman i would have asked you but if the last few years have proven anything it’s that you can’t tell a uterus from a unicycle good to know yeah a few more helpful hints like that you may find yourself on the council of ladies answering phone hello i see uh what time very well then huh that was the human resources department at the university apparently my assistant alex has filed a

a certain point in a woman’s menstrual cycle… i don’t see why i’m the one being persecuted here dr hofstadter he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen you know and howard wolowitz he spent two years using university resources building a sixbreasted sex robot oh and at the office christmas party i heard rajesh koothrappali refer to you several times as brown sugar yes no yeah but in his defense that wasn’t racist he’s also brown well hello actually i came to speak to mrs davis but i came to file a complaint somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature you you dirty birdie ii thought about the things you said to me yesterday and i realized i’m deeply offended now be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms and thanks to you i know better than to ask if you’re menstruating and based on your behaviour i don’t have to it has been pointed out to me that some of the things i said to you could be construed as offensive and i would like to offer you my sincerest apology yeah additionally you should know that the university has mandated that i take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesn’t happen in the future yeah now unfortunately uh my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this so um i’m gonna need you to take it for me oh and uh

gun yes i am uh elephant i’m sorry i’m just distracted by something that happened over at penny’s i fear penny is being unfaithful to leonard she claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment i have no choice but to assume the worst given leonard’s lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions oh really she and i once had a staring contest she clapped really loud and made me blink it’s a small leap from there to sexual infidelity amy there were chinese food containers in the trash can i hear a woman’s voice no it’s you all right i hear whispering

366,before you leave could you test these noisecancelling headphones okay go ahead aw now i’m sad i didn’t hear it well i’ve been struggling for months to come up with a theory of dark matter that doesn’t make protons decay i’m hoping to finally tackle it by optimising my work environment see i’ve got uh my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature uh i have fleecelined boxer shorts to keep my tushie toasty and then oh last but not least this inspirational cat poster improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade richard feynman oh i will nothing more fun than a paradigmshifting evening of science okay here we go proton decay proton decay time shift proton decay proton decay time shift proton decay proton decay how could there be with these constant interruptions i’m not going to work today and would you like to know why like a big old baby i’ve been cooped up in here too long maybe i need some fresh air knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny knock knock knock penny you sounded in distress i was worried something unpleasant was happening to you like a murder or spontaneous coitus with leonard well if you hate it then why are you doing it although i could ask the same question about coitus with leonard and to clarify i’m not going would you like to know why boy i’m not nearly as mysterious as i think i am yeah i was but after talking to penny i realised something i first she’s trying much harder to stay attractive in this relationship than you are and second the reason i may not be progressing in my research is i’ve created too pleasant of an environment for myself according to a classic psychological experiment by yerkes and dodson in order to maximize performance one must create a state of productive anxiety so i’d like to ask you all to do something for me keep me on my toes just throw me off my game essentially go out of your way to make my life miserable well i suppose… done you know i don’t want to tell you how to do your job but when a mouse completes a maze it gets a food pellet and his last meal was a food pellet you’re a monster very well and good luck i’m a pretty laidback guy i’m sorry i was aiming for your heart who eats them horizontally perhaps this was a waste of time thank you only do solid research i come to you for help and you insult me i thought the least that you would do would be… really oh that’s fantastic now wait they’re dropping why are they dropping oh that is infuriating ooh look they went back up again terrific oh no they went back down gentlemen i have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me i’d like you to be my intellectual sparring partners from now on when i make an assertion i need you to challenge it yes yes oh no it will see by keeping my mind engaged i’ll become more focused stop fighting me on the premise it’s scientifically valid i’m going to advance propositions i just want you to challenge me why of course it’s what i want why would i say it’s what i want if it’s not what i want i ask you for one simple thing and you can’t even do it yeah well then do it you guys are the worst thank you i think that was helpful knock knock knock ladies knock knock knock ladies knock knock knock ladies ladies well as you may know i’ve been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels and i thought what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk well conversations that you wouldn’t be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex you know who has the best cervix which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now men’s buttocks and how you want to pat and squeeze them and how difficult it is to do when she’s bloated cranky and crampy continue you talk about if werewolves can swim see leonard says yes but i say it depends on if the human could swim before he was bitten what do you think thank you oh and technically it’s apples that turn into wereoranges when the moon is full hey this is fun we should do it sometime when you aren’t all pms’ing bye oh uh i need to keep my anxiety at the right level so i’m using darth vader the joker and godzilla’s roar to keep me in that sweet spot uh i tried including taylor swift in the mix but turns out i love her boy taylor was right haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate of course yeah i can do both my brain is working at optimal capacity i can have a conversation with you and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time oh you said it i know it’s replaced godzilla as my principle source of anxiety he is getting a lot of work done he had a pretty interesting take on proton decay that nagging tone is helping my anxiety yeah but if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill that’d really put the zipadee in my doodah there you go perfect but after months of struggling i’m finally making progress or do i hmm sir isaac newton wrote his principia while convinced he was an armadillo yeah well maybe it is maybe it isn’t i have been hallucinating lately amy i have gotten more done in the last few days than i have since i made the switch to dark matter what if i stop doing this and it all goes away hmm perhaps but i’m not taking the cap off oh really what if i don’t and before you answer that can i have my dessert and then she threw me out me her very own boyfriend when all i’ve done is try to help humanity reach of the world we live in i knew you’d understand armadillo isaac newton hey what are you trying to pull the president of science isn’t in here okay hey i thought you were trying to trick me no no comfort is the enemy you know what’s comfortable slippers and blankets and panda bears imagine a panda bear with richard feynman’s face on it warm up the car leonard it’s poster time no i don’t want to go to sleep you can’t make me yeah darn straight you can’t try to tell a grown man to go to sleep that’s not gonna work oh i’m feeling much better and i’ve also been continuing to make progress

368,i’ve invented a science joke would you like to hear it how many edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb who cares he stole the idea and doesn’t deserve his own joke of course that’s how you know it’s a good joke it not only entertains it informs uh barry uh how many edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb what do you want barry oh no me as well uh please email it to sheldon at bazinga dot biz why dot biz because i just gave you the business and also bazinga dot com was taken since when do you help out barry kripke oh really when i was doing string theory and hit a dead end why didn’t you try to help me that’s pretty funny that does sound like me but that doesn’t mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along i’m being petty you know barry and i have a professional rivalry you heard him he told me to suck eggs if we were friends he would have suggested i suck something more pleasant why are you laughing did you learn something hello if i was okay i would’ve said hello and not the much more ominous hello i’m mad at amy no she helped barry kripke make an advancement in string theory well it would be except that i left string theory because i decided it was a dead end yeah and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong my rival no less i’m sorry you had to see that why would she do this to me no i said there’s nothing more important than me advancing science ugh let it go i have heard that my whole life every time something upsets me somebody says let it go you know like it’s my fault and it’s not okay to feel the way i feel is that all you have shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go gee penny life’s giving me lemons what should i do okay now you’re getting creative kripke you know of all the people barry kripke i’m so… are you folding that like a crazy person to get me to do it for you oh give me that just out of curiosity if i were to let something go how would i do that can i think about the spiny anteater the spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with barry kripke that didn’t help at all how does that work okay okay but i just got this pen it’s got my initials on it and everything look i may have a better way that you can teach me what if i told you that over the past few months amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab are you sure okay that’s great now let it go well excuse me amy was testing you i was rooting for you good job on that banana box by the way she’s been conducting an experiment on apes where they’re given various puzzles to solve i was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn’t be able to solve them that’s when amy said want to make this interesting no no we designed an experiment involving you see now isn’t that interesting okay maybe this will help imagine you’re holding a pen before you go too far not a special pen with your initials engraved on it that’ll make the next part really hard i don’t understand why you’re mad at me you should be mad at amy like i was this afternoon hey look at that i let it go penny i think i left my pen in there i can’t i’m naked hang on thank you that sounds like us i still don’t understand why you’re upset you solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps oh i can help you with that imagine you’re holding an ordinary pen while your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket may i say something but i think it would be comforting when i lost my own father i didn’t have any friends to help me through it you do i didn’t care for her yelling but now that i’m not going to hear it again i’m sad it won’t be as good,Sheldon
369,oh that’s nonsense i proclaimed my love for you and the last time i looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis yeah but we don’t have to debate this we’re scientists we can conduct our own research i propose that we imprison two street people and… you didn’t even let me finish so you can experiment on all the apes you want but i want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings suddenly i’m the monster in the interest of science i’d be willing to yes uh fun fact pontificate comes from the latin word pontifex which means bridge builder or pope just out of curiosity penny if this experiment does make us fall in love would you drive me to lake geneva wisconsin for gary con it’s the only convention celebrating the life and work of gary gygax the cocreator of dungeons and dragons okay babe let’s do this you ready to begin correct you’re not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery well as a texas gentleman i’m inclined to say ladies first although i’m concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins perhaps we should flip a coin or if you’re familiar with the rules of rock paper scissors… hmm living or dead ah that’s just as well as much as i’d love to meet euclid inventor of the geometric proof he probably wore sandals and i cannot look at toes during dinner oh i know the person i’d most like to have dinner with is myself well i haven’t and while they say never meet your heroes i just don’t see how i could disappoint who would you choose oh i didn’t think of iron man you know maybe after myself and i have dinner we can meet you two for dessert what would constitute a perfect day for you that’s it you didn’t mention leonard i don’t think so leonard can’t stand yoga the beach massages or dancing uh i wake up uh i enjoy some french toast with butter and syrup uh then a wormhole opens and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race who do you think made the french toast with butter and syrup if you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability what would it be i don’t think you’re taking this seriously i believe what you’re doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability ha keep dreaming when are we going to get robot eyes well what i meant was i often misinterpret how others are feeling like i can’t always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me you know like uh if they’re mad at something i’ve done or just in a bad mood it it’s incredibly stressful well i’m not and if i could read people’s minds life would be so much simpler thank you you sure it’s not too much bible juice so it would be today huh well i suppose there’s something satisfying about dying on my birthday yes well i don’t enjoy presents and the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words george lucas director’s cut the point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other thank you you’re making it difficult to love you right now that’s it we’re done with the questions okay wait hang on bladder check we’re good to go yes we’re not supposed to talk during this part this is kind of creepy well you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a formula one race car so i’m just concentrating on that plus it’s easier around people that i’m comfortable with of course you are i’m warm and soothing i’m like a human bowl of tomato soup oh well i suppose i do think of you as a sister and sometimes a mother what it was a monday afternoon you joined us for indian food yeah and you’re still eating our food i remember it perfectly but i have an eidetic memory if you’re interested i also remember how much you owe us for the food no it wasn’t uh now let’s tabulate the results of the experiment i think it’s safe to say that you’re not in love with me and i’m not in love with you and psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences and i you and yes that’s how you say that yeah so given our newfound intimacy i’d say we have some hard choices to make gary con do we fly or drive do we wear costumes and if so who gets to be gary thank you for walking me home well this is me it’s been a very interesting evening aah and after i let you be gary,Sheldon
370,oh good you’re back as you know amy and i have been together a long time and a lot of things i never thought possible now seem possible do you want to say it sarcasm okay that was tricky ’cause when it comes to alcohol she generally means business no it’s true it means that we care so much about each other there’s enough left over for an eightounce reptile after much deliberation we’ve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet they don’t shed fur they don’t make noise yeah and if he ever goes berserk i know i can outrun him coincidentally that’s also why i chose you as a roommate oh dear lord oh dear lord that was a lot of puppies oh i don’t know he kind of looks like a jerk how about this one i know i like him too hi little guy how’d you like to come home with us you’ll be living with me because we don’t live in the same house or if they accept daddy’s application to live on mars oh there’s this company that’s attempting to establish a colony on mars and i applied to be among the first to go what should we name him you know i came in thinking seth but he kind of looks italian would you have approved well based on your reaction it looks like i made the right choice isn’t that right giuseppe i can’t believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home i was playing got your nose that’s how you get children to like you ugh this again amy i’ve already had one new hole torn in my body today i don’t need another one so you’re saying you wouldn’t leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet huh that’s exactly what leonard wolowitz koothrappali bernadette and penny said first of all this has only made me stronger but beyond that all i did was fill out an application is there anything i can do to cheer you up what if i play the star trek theme on my nose yep you’re mad i was going to make you red zinger but since mars is the red planet i went with peppermint actually as part of the application i was required to make a short video answering that very question you want to see it but i made a video i’m dr sheldon cooper and i’d like to tell you why i should be chosen to go to mars i’m exceedingly smart i graduated college at while my brother was getting an std i was getting a phd penicillin can’t take this away being in close quarters cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable in fact animals don’t trust me because i smell like nothing literally nothing during the sevenmonth space flight i can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour hey leonard is there any peanut brittle left in that can yes open it and check but on a more serious note the most important reason i want to go to mars is that i believe as a scientist it’s my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward now i know that life on mars will be difficult but life here on earth is no picnic also picnics are no picnic where should we go for lunch oh i know the ground in conclusion thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime to mars afterwards leonard blew his nose and pie came out why i really don’t understand what’s happening here amy oh why didn’t i give her sleepy time tea amy wait getting a turtle meant a great deal to me too do you want me to withdraw my application and in that future are we on the same planet because i’ve seen people make the longdistance thing work okay does that planet have to be earth i am yeah if i’m going to a barren lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none i want you there with me why don’t we go back to the apartment and fill out your application oh i know we could be the first to plant a flag on mars we could be the first to watch mars attacks on mars we could be the first to say good lord what on mars are you talking about you just can’t keep it in your space pants can you they would wouldn’t they we could give them cool martian names and we could teach them about martian history like who planted those flags and uh where did that copy of mars attacks come from good idea and since you’ve had such a rough day i’m gonna let you throw the pie in leonard’s face,Sheldon
371,two one six four two zero one nine eight nine and that little lady is pi to a thousand places oh look it’s the scientific american that covered the paper leonard and i wrote i have mixed feelings about doing interviews i like the part where i talk i do not like the part where the other man talks well that can’t be right all i did was answer a few questions about the theory and then expressed my gratitude that scientific american doesn’t include any of those smelly perfume cards why the theory he came up with just got mentioned in scientific american he ought to be thrilled oh maybe you’re right he is kind of a lump oh i’d be incensed squeaky wheel gets the grease grass is always greener well i don’t know we’re all groot just tell me but it wasn’t my fault i didn’t exclude him and i didn’t write the article oh that kid poor leonard for the record that kid was a terrible choice if you cry when you drop your churro you do not have what it takes to rule england leonard have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill good good and your name is on the electric bill and mine isn’t and i’m okay with that oh right this is a disaster okay i have to tell you something but you’re not going to like it an article was just published in scientific american about our theory no no they loved it they uh couldn’t say enough nice things about it you know how the pennysaver only has my name… they didn’t mention you in the article only me i know it’s not fair let the anger go buddy you just you relax all your muscles except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter let’s keep those tight it is they’re what hold back the urine and the faeces look maybe maybe you shouldn’t read it it’ll only make you feel worse you should know i had nothing to do with that you know you’re right yeah you know it’s like when stan lee and steve ditko created spiderman stan lee may get all the credit but steve ditko knows he was just as important even though stan lee gets to be in all the marvel movies and and he’s far richer and he’s a household name you know whereas you know you say ditko and that sounds like a company that makes dits well i’d give more examples but well everyone in your position’s so forgettable knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard i spoke to the reporter at the magazine i did he said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist well i know it was your idea but the reporter said he’s been following my work for a while and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is ’cause my name is on it well then what if i told you that i added your name to the cable bill oh that’s just as well they had me on hold for minutes and i hung up knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard knock knock knock leonard also wolowitz invited us all to dinner so i’m ready whenever you are all he had was an idea oh please i have ideas all day long reverse seaworld where dolphins are allowed to pet people a new clothing size between medium and large called marge snow white retold from the point of view of sneezy why won’t doc prescribe him something we finally find out fine then grumpy what’s he so grumpy about maybe his girlfriend won’t take his side is it my fault i have a much bigger reputation than he does is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist i didn’t correct him hi hello oh and a special hello to leonard who needs to be mentioned by name but you got it right of course indeed penny a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day i don’t believe it matters what the topic is what’s crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way it’s all about the execution yeah good for you leonard that’s a lovely little notion kind of like i wish i could talk to my uncle in chicago yeah now stand back while i invent the telephone hello oh hold on leonard it’s your uncle he says you just got burned well said old chap i thought eloquence had died here it stands before us starting today it’ll go gettysburg address i have a dream and what he just said leonard please his mother just died yeah so are you leonard lots of people could’ve had that idea but very few people could’ve worked out the math the way i did oh well apparently leonard thinks he’s better than everyone in the whole world including those fighting for our freedom yeah well i don’t know about you but i support our boys overseas hey you already ruined thor give it a rest i didn’t hog anything unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it she said my name first that must kill you you see penny the israelites were in the desert… hang on physics today mentioned the paper they did,Sheldon
372,leonard i’ve been working on an opening joke for our lecture at berkeley okay um what do you say to a graduate of the uc berkeley physics department i’ll have fries with that because his education hasn’t prepared him for a career in the sciences yeah i think so i just restocked the old prk i don’t see what’s crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and purell and rubber gloves uh air freshener um noisecancelling headphones oh danger whistle um pepper spray ooh a multilanguage occupied sign uh let’s see we have seat protectors uh booties for my shoes a clothespin for my nose oh and a mirror on a stick so i can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn’t some kind of weirdo would you like to play a physics car game i invented called i can’t spy it’s all the nailbiting tension of i spy but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum i’ll begin uh i can’t spy with my little eye something passing right through us will you please play the game i can’t spy with my little eye something passing right through us i don’t want to play anymore we get it you won the game stop bragging i suppose it is in fact if you’d like to celebrate with a little music i’d be okay with that play that funky music white boy what reference so they’re requesting that the white boy play the funky music yes and this music we’re listening to right now is funky as well let me ask you this do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays so it’s like the musical equivalent of russell’s paradox the question of whether the set of all sets that don’t contain themselves as members contains itself well then i hate it music should just be fun will our hotel room be ready aren’t you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective seems a little confrontational but all right you know we won’t be very far from skywalker ranch why not yoda’s swamp was in the middle of nowhere tatooine was in the middle of nowhere hoth was in the middle of nowhere that’s code leonard he wants us to drop in yes oh i’m so excited and i just can’t hide it what are you talking about there it is it’s just a gate on a road this is so amazing i want more than a picture i want to go in is that the attitude that helped you get penny there’s a speaker box drive up push the button and let’s see what happens well get over it confidence is key in these situations you pushed it are you out of your mind you’re blowing it we want to meet george lucas and become his friends and play with him all right we’ve defeated the first challenge now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate i think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy but one quest at a time so what’s the plan honesty will never get us in all right my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse’s office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed oh you are killing me what if i told you that i was the voice of yoda a recording session i must attend shedding the yoke of my oppressors you blind sad little man i can see the ranch leonard oh it’s rustic it’s lovely i’d take a picture but people are chasing me i’m gonna make it i’m gonna make it they have tasers but they wouldn’t dare use… aaaaaaagh do you think they’re gonna call the police oh i think that’s below the pay grade of an imperial officer stormtroopers are really the ones who… so what are you in for but why are you here excuse me leonard they have a sculpture gallery uh one question about that picture can it be with george lucas ooh grumpy you are are you still mad at me boy some people are just glasshalfempty before i answer was he a smoker i think you’re looking at this all wrong well not only did we go to skywalker ranch we got in and no one we know can say that and for all the times you find me irritating today you got to watch someone shoot me with a taser see i’ll take your word for it i was too busy trying not to defecate that’s amazing and i saw jabba the hutt riding by on a motorcycle although that was right after the tasing so who can say for sure it was and even though we’re not allowed back there they can never take today away from us unlike my sense of smell which hasn’t returned since the tasing no i got nothing amy the daleks are right on my tail quick we need to reset the time circuits oh no i left my sonic screwdriver behind,Sheldon
373,well i’ll give you three guesses why i’m so irritated i guess news travels fast it’s true a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of richard feynman and i wasn’t included you’re just saying that to make me feel better agreed sure it’s not like i was invited to richard feynman’s house and have anything better to do i don’t know the future do you think there’s a chance that an asteroid could hit the earth destroying feynman’s house and everyone in it then buckle up you’re in for a cranky night you know i just put that in because of uterus stuff i was afraid you might bring this up so i have a workaround there you go as far as you’re concerned i’m smiling although i must admit i’m smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things you know what i used to be a fan of evolution but i’ve since evolved and now i think it’s dumb hey look at that even in your example you’re all by yourself i can just picture them all right now at feynman’s house probably discussing schrodinger and at the same time not discussing schrodinger see they’re missing out on hilarious jokes like that it reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldn’t let me in i hated that so much isn’t that a little juvenile i’ll get the blankets you google how to have childlike fun wonderful i just finished hanging the lights yes oh but enter through the side batman is a loadbearing blanket i know this isn’t the printout this is my real face roughing it okay everything looks so big from down here this must be how leonard feels okay so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest or fort off are fort knox fort ticonderoga fort sumter and fort cozy mcblanket mmhmm wait no we haven’t picked a winner well of course we do fort knox doesn’t have a secret physics lending library well wait what if just this once we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later that’s a big step very well i will agree to a familyfriendly grated boygirl sleepover grated with a warning for families with babies and toddlers do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas it would but you know how much i admire preparedness how did you know we’d be in the living room we built a fort well leonard don’t you want to see the inside of the fort oh come on i really wanted to tell someone they can’t come in i want to say no but it’s too glorious get in here not there that’s my spot,Sheldon

384,listen to this i just received an email from wil wheaton leonard nimoy’s son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away it’s about mr spock and his impact on our culture well they’re looking for fans to interview and wil thought i’d be good for it absolutely not yeah penny you spent some time in front of the camera any words of advice this is a documentary about mr spock i’m sure if there’s nudity it will be tasteful hello amy it’s sheldon yeah i i know that we’re broken up but i’m leaving this message because i thought perhaps you’d like to watch me be interviewed for a documentary about mr spock or as i like to call it a spockumentary yeah i’m going to use that joke in the interview so try to laugh like you’re hearing it for the first time you know hysterically hmm and with a tinge of sadness that i’m no longer in your life hello oh it’s nice to meet you i admire your father’s work very much it’s not every day i get to meet someone whose life’s journey began in my hero’s scrotum all right but this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt dr sheldon cooper theoretical physicist caltech i think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere the dream of a cold rational world entirely without human emotion spock came from a planet governed only by logic you know on vulcan when your brother asks why are you hitting yourself the answer is i’m not you’re moving my arm to which he says fascinating and then you both watch educational television i have many my most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend penny that’s her over there of course excuse me this will just take a moment when there was no more room in the floor safe when we got the security camera aquaman protecting your home since yeah you don’t have to tell me not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth so we are currently in the presence of leonard nimoy’s dna no offence but this is pure nimoy because of your mother you’re only which isn’t bad but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away wouldn’t you like to know all right then see just my valuables my passport uh my will yeah my scale wil wheaton action figure i also have the other kind of will and in it i will my wil back to wil oh that is an engagement ring that i was going to give my girlfriend amy no no this has been in my family for generations except for a short time when comanches cut off my greatgreatgreatgrandmother’s finger and stole it no the texas rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them it was a happy ending well for my ninefingered nana no she broke up with me before i could broach the subject no not at all no i’m fine you know amy had reservations about our relationship so all worked out for the best i said i’m fine long pause we’ve gotten a little offtopic allow me to make things entertaining again in this little spockumentary that was leonard’s joke as a child when faced with a dilemma my mother encouraged me to ask what would jesus do the answer to that was always love thy neighbour but my neighbour had a dead tooth so that wasn’t going to happen but that’s why i changed it to what would spock do yes oh for example three years ago when i discovered penny was eating all my poptarts instead of getting angry or vindictive you know i got a floor safe oh certainly uh when i was eight years old billy sparks cornered me in the playground i asked myself what would spock do then i grabbed billy on his shoulder and performed my first vulcan nerve pinch oh no he broke my collarbone i can still hear it click oh not at all as i said the entire point of emulating spock was to rise above human emotion which i’ve spent a lifetime mastering excuse me no you went pfft what does pfft mean not true no look at me i had an engagement ring to give a girl and instead she rejected me and am i emotional about that no no i am sitting here on a couch talking about my favourite tv character like nothing happened ‘cause i am just like him all logical all the time because when i speak at a regular volume no one seems to believe me that i’ve put this amy nonsense behind me hello better did wil and adam leave do you think they’re going to put my outburst in the documentary well there’s no point in dwelling on it as the vulcans say kupfuntor ha’kiv na’ish du stau well this is ridiculous being upset about amy all the time isn’t accomplishing anything if i want to resolve this situation then i need to take action i’m going to find her and ask her to marry me and if she says yes we can put this behind us and resume our relationship and if she says no well then she can just ponfo miran yeah right you can just shut your feelings off there goes television lying to us again we let you raise our children and this is the thanks we get leonard how could i have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a madeup

385,oh dr and mrs hofstadter lovely to see you this fine morning yeah i am indeed i have decided instead of wallowing in sadness about amy it is time that i find myself a new female companion i realized something when amy was in my life i was hyperfocused on my work and ignored her no i need a new woman in my life to ignore so i can hyperfocus on my work again on oatmeal day ooh that’s a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl you know what you eat it you’re married it doesn’t matter what you look like thank you for coming by gentlemen well it was the two of you who found amy farrah fowler for me now that i’m looking for my next girlfriend it seemed only logical that i employ your services once again oh no it’s all right i think of my time with amy as a stick of fruit stripe gum sweet and enjoyable at first but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness gentlemen all i’m looking for is an educated intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view she should be kind patient and most important unable to imagine life without me by ten o’clock tonight all right fine she doesn’t need her own point of view now chopchop are you sure i’ve heard that on those sites often when you think you’re corresponding with someone it’s actually a computer program pretending to be a real person excuse me no one does a better job pretending to be a person than i do siri comes close but i know more jokes off the top of my head uh prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains and she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory and then sits quietly by my side while i watch daredevil people compete for jobs and trophies why not me and i have the soulful eyes of a cow oh we’ll make the puzzles extremely challenging to eliminate unworthy candidates that’s it the sheldon cooper girlfriend challenge is officially live right now somewhere a woman is dividing the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colours in the oldest national flag still in use and taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter love and best of all rules golly she sounds too good to be true someone will show someone will show well by that logic i should be with someone short dull and needy eh not to cast aspersions but i can’t shake a stick around here without hitting that one minute is a long time seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me you know probably half that if i break out the old cow eyes uhoh what if it’s jennifer lawrence well that last hunger games was not my cup of tea oh fine i won’t shut my heart to the love of jennifer lawrence sounds like a drama queen oh no it is jennifer lawrence all right can i help you yes careful it’s addictive and just like that you’re a klingonsanskrit junkie i am a bit of a unicorn well you certainly seem like a special lady uh but as you know you missed the deadline so thanks for playing she was late and she found atomic spectroscopy boring well i wouldn’t coitus her with your genitals,Sheldon

of my nose plugs fell into the toilet before you do please give me one more chance to apologize to emily emily as i’m sure you know i’m considered an odd fellow but what you don’t know is that while i

1008,in a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets who wins the second world war defend correct my turn tuned bayonets isn’t it obvious we postulate an alternate world that differs from ours in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other in a world ruled by a giant beaver mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord the lowlying city of copenhagen is flooded thousands die devastated the danes never invent their namesake pastry how does one miss that is he always like this when he loses perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities we’ll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide very good leonard but next time don’t tell us where you’re hiding hello i must take responsibility i had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies actually i’m not in order to avoid surprises i wear them all the time shamy oh i don’t like that don’t do that well just recently i learned that you refer to us as shamy and i don’t like that like everybody else’s subject to entropy decay and eventual death thank you for asking why is she not taking our order really i assumed an establishment called the cheesecake factory would function more efficiently you’re right he’s a festival of humdrum chitchat i doubt you’d understand sheldon tells me you only have a master’s degree i’m curious as to why we’re not eating alone it’s very impressive for theoretical work i’m sorry was i being too subtle i meant compared to the realworld applications of neurobiology theoretical physics is what’s the word i’m looking for hmm cute i’m stating it outright babinski eats dirac for breakfast and defecates clarkemaxwell absolutely not my colleagues and i are mapping the neurological substrates that subserve global information processing which is required for all cognitive reasoning including scientific inquiry making my research ipso facto prior in the ordo cognoscendi that means it’s better than his research and by extension of course yours yes but if i’m successful i will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in deriving a grand unified theory and therefore subsume your conclusions under my paradigm we appear to have reached an impasse seconded good day sheldon cooper your mother thinks you might be losing your mind over me as a neurobiologist i was curious excellent point touche i’ll agree to that only if you’ll stipulate that of our difficulties were caused by you sixtyfive i do i find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillating i would i love cats they’re the epitome of indifference next next,Amy
1009,may i offer an observation from a neurobiological standpoint leonard you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromonebased stink of desperation i understand that some people find mates in social gathering places such as bars or taverns have you tried a bar or tavern that’s not true of all bars juice bars for example that was rude cornucopia what a mellifluous word agreed and we’ll use mellifluous tomorrow wait i have a request i’d like you to meet my mother certainly good night amy farrah fowler all right leaves sheldon i believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when i asked you to meet my mother in what way are you screwed all i want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother so she’ll be satisfied that i’m in a relationship precisely don’t be absurd i find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct that adds no value to human relationships i trust this clarification allows us to return to boyslashfriendslashgirlslashfriend status sheldon please you’re suffocating me good night sheldon you wanted me to have a boyfriend mother well here he is have to sign off now my hunger for sheldon is stirring in my loins thank you sheldon that went very well,Amy
1010,actually as the newest member of your social group i believe i’ll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily siding with your friends from time to time leonard you’re right we should enjoy our meal arrive late and risk winding up with terrible seats assuming we get in at all see it’s working girls’ night what does that entail i’m a girl no need penny and i are very close yes in fact our menses are synchronized penny bernadette tells me you’re planning a girls’ night i’m a girl yes but they’re not girls i’m a girl what’s the dress code all right i’ll have to go shopping so anyway to make a long story short turns out i have an unusually firm cervix shame ‘cause i have a real zinger about my titled uterus a colleague of mine did her graduate thesis on the fungus that grows on improperly sterilized manicure implements well don’t tell me that’s not girl talk yes and continue to bond i have a feeling that after tonight one of you will become my best friend forever or bff if you prefer which i don’t oh good a slumber party we’ll do makeovers initiate phony phone calls and have spirited pillow fights in our frilly nighties well that’s disappointing i’ve always wanted to be invited to a slumber party well there was the time i had my tonsils out and i shared a room with a little vietnamese girl she didn’t make it through the night but up till then it was kind of fun pillow fight my nails have never looked so pretty before get it off i’m not sure i grasp the full entertainment value but all right next on wikipedia’s list of slumber party activities truth or dare hang on i’m familiarizing myself with the rules seems fairly straightforward bernadette truth or dare all right to what temperature must you heat beef in order to kill the prion that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy remember you have to answer honestly oh all right what is the circumference of your areolas and absolon hath kist hir nether yea and nicholas is scalded in the towte this tale is doon and god save al the rowte” bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story the miller’s tale by chaucer is the dirtiest story i know it would have been hidden in sock drawers if people in the th century had worn socks you might not like it as much if you knew what nether yea meant hint if one cares about hygiene one ought not be kissing it oh that’s an excellent question for two people who claim to be no longer pairbonded you spend an inordinate amount of time in each other’s company i don’t believe the rules allow for an ex post facto option change then why did you terminate your relationship with him interesting how will you react if in the future you become ready for it and leonard is unavailable because another woman has realized that he is to use your words a great guy well i’m not sure how this is scored but i believe we may have won clearly losing truth or dare upset her perhaps we should try to take her mind off it with another popular slumber party activity well the internet suggests that slumber party guests often engage in harmless experimentation with lesbianism penny don’t worry i’ll avoid the nether yea,Amy
1011,did you know that the iconic valentine’s heart shape is not actually based on the shape of a human heart but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over hoo i’m often flummoxed by current slang does went out mean had intercourse interesting and was it not satisfactory hoo i’m suddenly feeling flushed my heart rate is elevated my palms are clammy my mouth is dry in addition i keep involuntarily saying hoo it’s no mystery i obviously have the flu coupled with suddenonset tourette’s syndrome it’s too thin if i were making a footlong brain sandwich at quiznos for examination under a twophoton microscope it’s fine very well if you die and donate your body to science i promise to slice your brain like canadian bacon now if you’ll excuse me i have to take my temperature no i experienced some distressing symptoms last night so i’m checking my vital signs every hour oh that sounds like fun elevated heart rate moist palms dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing ears and genitalia i was sitting in a restaurant with penny and bernadette drinking water carbonated as it was a special occasion penny’s friend zack stopped by and said hello and i said hoo zack ask what zack hoo why do you keep saying zack i’m not saying hoo now i said hoo last night there was no question i simply said hoo where would i have picked up an alien parasite my blood work shows thyroid function normal cortisol levels normal sheldon i am not going through menopause i think we need to face the cold hard truth i was sexually aroused by penny’s friend zack let’s look at this logically i have a stomach i get hungry i have genitals i have the potential for sexual arousal religion no are you suggesting we live our lives guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction what are you doing is it possible that your concern for me at this moment is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy and you reject it because you don’t feel jealousy or because you are suppressing jealousy that’s not your lunch sheldon those are the cadaver brain specimens i’m sure it’ll wash off there’s zack it’s not what i want to do it’s what i have to do thank you sheldon you’re a good friend excuse me zack i am amy farrah fowler we met the other night i have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge until i met you my decisions were founded in logic and reason and yet here i stand before you pounds of raging estrogen longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make shakespeare’s metaphorical beast with two backs on the other hand as i look at the blank apelike expression on your face i have decided to adopt the vulcan practice of kolinar goodbye zack as am i holds sheldon’s hand an experiment nope nothing never mind,Amy
1012,penny a moment do you have plans this weekend that’s too bad i was hoping you could be my plusone at the institute of interdisciplinary studies’ symposium on the impact of current scientific research on societal interactions shame since you’re my best friend i thought it would be a good bonding opportunity don’t you read my blog do you know anybody else who would appreciate an allexpensepaid spa weekend at a fourstar resort in big sur please don’t touch my breasts all right i just want to establish boundaries that does seem to be a valid principle i don’t believe there’s any such thing yes he had you in the other car but i got you upgraded no we discussed it we decided we didn’t want to jeopardize our relationship by getting to know each other too well don’t worry penny you’re my plusone you’ll bunk with me and fyi travel makes me constipated so i’m the ideal hotel roommate are you usually radioactive when found in nature are you in the lanthanoid series i missed you still nothing remind me to try again in an hour so girl talk do you subscribe to the freudian theory of penis envy sometimes i think it might be nice to have one not for sex for convenience you can’t deny that by comparison our internal plumbing is extremely high maintenance we have time now think about it not necessary penny and i are perfectly comfortable sharing a bed of course we’re best friends word of warning though i’m prone to night terrors so if i wake up kicking and screaming don’t panic just pin me down and stroke my hair and i’ll be fine are we talking about women wanting penises because i’d like to weigh in hi bestie leonard can i ask you a question are you bothered by the fact that your former girlfriend left the symposium with what is probably the most beautiful man i’ve ever seen in my life because we’re going miles per hour,Amy
1013,so what do you think not even when i do this pretends to be a fish well that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy if this humiliating experience is really troubling you there are things we could do about it well the first thing that comes to mind is isolating the part of your brain where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser all right have you considered improving your socialization skills thus allowing you to communicate more effectively with other people fair enough but in its essence teaching is a performance art in the classroom paradigm the teacher has the responsibility to communicate as well as entertain and engage perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons,Amy
1014,well normally i respect your macho rebellious attitude toward the man but in this case i think you’ve made a foolish mistake sheldon like it or not until you manage to upload your intelligence into a selfsustaining orbiting satellite equipped with highspeed internet and a cloaking device you will be dependent on other members of the human race i’m not finished all scientists have to fundraise sheldon how do you think i paid for my lab technically faisal is my fiance but i do have a stateoftheart twophoton microscope and a place to stay in riyadh for the winter and consider this without you to make the case for the physics department the task will fall to people like leonard and rajesh well then prepare to be terrified if your friends are unconvincing this year’s donations might go to say the geology department or worse it could go to the liberal arts millions of dollars being showered on poets literary theorists and students of gender studies,Amy
1015,i came as quickly as i could to comfort you of course sheldon told me about leonard dating rajesh’s sister so i hightailed it over here to pick up the pieces of your broken heart you don’t have to be strong for me now let’s talk about priya that manstealing bitch in situations like this best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman rawr oh then perhaps you don’t understand what’s going on your former boyfriend has replaced you with what appears to be a very suitable mate arguably much more suitable than you well granted penny your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious but priya is highly educated she’s an accomplished professional and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex whereas you on the other hand are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows this is a portable electroencephalogram i’m doing research on emotions and brain activity so when you start crying i can see which region of the brain is activated then i’m going to stimulate the analogous area in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries cool huh hi bestie so how you holding up oh who are you kidding she’s breathtaking i’m regretting my earlier cattiness she is an absolute delight i just wanted to check in on you it seems like the appropriate thing to do when one’s best friend finds herself replaced by a smart beautiful woman with the smouldering sexuality of a crouched bengal tiger it’s okay it’s okay now let’s get these electrodes attached and see what’s going on in that pretty little noggin of yours what up bestie good news thanks to you i was able to make a rhesus monkey cry like a disgraced televangelist so you feeling better sheldon you have a guest who’s upset,Amy
1016,sheldon are you all right when last we spoke you were going to take a taxi home from raj’s but according to facebook you just checked in at the cheesecake factory wise hi bestie fine from this angle i can see up your nose penny i’m sorry you got dragged into this i know you’re devastated that your exboyfriend has found an exciting new lover with flawless caramelcoloured skin your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise sheldon look at me i think it’s time to face the fact that leonard is the nucleus of your social group where he goes the group goes i’m not saying that you’re not fun you’re the most fun person i know don’t be needy bestie that’s probably part of what chased leonard away what i am saying sheldon is that your group is leonardcentric if it were a town it would be leonardville if it were an islamic nation leonardstan if it were the birthplace of motion pictures we’d all be singing hooray for leonardwood so needy yo pdog parenthetical the term kidnap is being used playfully good now put this pillowcase over your head she used to be much more fun until leonard punched her in the heart you do understand that it will distract you from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving that your exboyfriend is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of mumbai yes if you’d have let me bring the chloroform we wouldn’t have had to put up with all this jibberjabber yes perhaps somewhere packed tightly with young beautiful bodies sweating and writhing against each other in a glorious orgy of the flesh that should display enough of your bosom to attract a new mate or a hungry infant what’s that like you know if being on your own is new to you i’d be happy to share some tensionrelieving techniques for ladies i’ve perfected over the years for example do you have an electric toothbrush you should get one it appears to be something preserved between two pieces of acrylic saying that while holding a snowflake is a little bit heavyhanded don’t you think outstanding and if we fail we can always stop at cvs and pick you out a nice toothbrush i call mine gerard,Amy
1017,i think you’re on ah here’s the alcohol and drug peer pressure mother warned me about i was starting to think it was never going to happen yes please i’m drunk this may be the alcohol talking but i believe there is are you familiar with the recent study of tanzanian chimpanzees by nishida and hosaka out of kyoto university primates such as ourselves have a natural instinct to ostracize illmannered members of the troop bernadette’s urge to shun scowl or fling her waste at priya is hardwired into her dna believe me it’s there we all have it hit me with some more booze and i’ll show you well well well look who it is because i do that now four women walk down the stairs how many reach the lobby,Amy
1018,i’m glad you talked me into this we work so hard sometimes it’s nice to goof off and do something silly say i heard an interesting tidbit about howard and bernadette now now evolutionary biologist robin dunbar has identified gossip as an aid to social bonding in large groups what if he’s right and by not participating in gossip society breaks down into small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish bernadette is thinking about breaking up with howard did i tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction fascinating work i recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes yes he looks much cooler than the nonsmoking monkeys although it’s not much of a contest the other monkeys just sit around and masturbate by all means i don’t understand the original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup it’s not surprising that the story has captured the attention of our little circle of friends are you familiar with meme theory meme theory suggests that items of gossip are like living things that seek to reproduce using humans as their host i should think so that’s gold do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation we need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip then we’ll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of memetic theory algebraic gossip and epidemiology sheldon and i engaged in sexual intercourse in other news i’m thinking of starting an herb garden mum’s the word gotta go every word our false gossip meme appears to have reached node lambda agreed it appears the rate of gossip transmission is proportional to the number of nodes squared slow down sheldon i’m not quite there yet bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you the meme has reached full penetration no happy accident i should let you know that she asked for details about our dalliance pun intended not important i described your lovemaking as aloof but effective i wonder what changed her mind as good an explanation as any yes not important just stopped by to let you know i’m getting orthotics also i’m carrying sheldon’s baby mum’s the word wow is there anything on there about orthotics,Amy

1061,are rajesh and leonard competing for it as well do they know they don’t stand a chance ’cause you’re so great or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability and move out buy a house get married start a family you know if you really want tenure maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision you don’t say is that a problem well you better have a good excuse this time because trimming qtips to fit your ears right is obvious nonsense it sounds like a long and tedious evening oh well in that case perhaps i should come along of course it would i’m wellversed in academic politics and as a respected scientist i can only raise your stock as a candidate let’s go over our emotional responses one last time professor tupperman is dead and that makes us the fact that there are so many people here tonight doesn’t make us cranky and claustrophobic it makes us giving mrs davis the box set of roots was no i’d like to know why penny’s here she plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee to further leonard’s cause you’re all wasting your time sheldon is the most qualified for the job and no amount of gravitydefying bosom’s going to change that seriously is that tape like how are they staying up like that sheldon well you’ll always be an academic success but i seriously question whether you’ll make any more friends should have taken my breasts out while i had the chance,Amy
1062,i’m sorry you’re upset you know sheldon sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like this okay well what i think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure you know i might be able to help you with this there’s a whole field of behavioural neuroscience that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you less you sure about that i’ve come up with a series of exercises to help with your compulsive need for closure all i’m saying is we live in a world where closure isn’t always an op… i’m going to recondition your brain so that the need for completion isn’t so overwhelming yep your turn exactly how does that make you feel and that’s exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment come on you can do this yeah sounds like a drag let’s box it up i’m a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive and i’m proud of you sheldon exits,Amy

1089,no and neither did our waiter it’s hard to argue with that and i know because i saw a sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail sheldon how about tomorrow night we see a movie it’s better than hot it’s binding you are aware that a double date doesn’t count as two dates i then suggested a pub after a lively debate that proposal passed by a twozero margin there they go fighting again you’d never hear her talk that way to sauvignon blanc it’s a good thing i’m not wearing flag underwear right now ’cause there’s about to be a fire so when do you guys plan on getting married of course can i have a bite of your burger they developed the relationship closeness inventory which predicts the stability of a couple based on behaviour sheldon and i got an eightpointtwo out of ten i’m gonna let you count this as two dates they’re a lot of work no we’re sorry we never should have been comparing relationships in the first place it would make me so happy if you said things like that sheldon what did you expect i’ll tell you what if we stay i’ll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead does it matter,Amy
1090,so howard is stuart still living with your mom i’m with him three years nothing she’s with him two minutes and he’s taking his pants off we have led different lives you really went your entire life without anyone saying i hate you to your face i’d say it now but look at those cheekbones hmmhmm what if you just hang around and act like her friend until you wear her down i mean next thing you know you’re in her home you’re eating her food drinking her wine you’re right cheers i’m gonna go with penny on this one then again why wouldn’t i i mean we go way back shh amy’s here now of course i’m feeling a little backed into a corner sheldon interesting can you see how a grown man an accomplished scientist who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources then i think it’s a terrific idea,Amy
1091,you know when you bend over i can see down your shirt most universities have them when i was an undergrad i spent three days in one pledging a sorority no they forgot i was there but it really opened up my pores save you first come back for raj only if there’s time sheldon i’m really impressed you’re willing to try this you guys doing okay down there you guys doing okay down there i’m going to the vending machine do you want anything okay just checking anything else sheldon is everything okay minutes that’s longer than i thought do you really need me to transcribe this,Amy
1092,i’m studying onecelled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame i think it’s awful bernadette is a successful microbiologist she should be celebrated for her achievements not her looks i mean what kind of message does that send i just don’t think a professional woman should have to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead maybe it’s different in the world of sales but it’s already hard enough for women to be taken seriously in science so how was work today what happened well i’m really sorry but i think it’s for the best you want people focusing on your achievements not staring at your breasts in some magazine sorry it’s just we’re we were talking about them so look i i wasn’t going to say anything but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled i have a little confession i’m the reason it was pulled i sent the editors of the magazine a pretty scathing email i simply pointed out that they would never consider doing an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality let alone showing them in various stages of undress well it doesn’t make a difference because they agreed it was in bad taste and now you agree so amy saves the day but it was bad publicity i disagree as a female scientist i think what you do affects all of us you have a nice night nice flowers isn’t she lucky what’s that i guess that’s all anybody wants well i hope you get it i can’t take these but what about the other girl we all have a past that has to wait this weirdo locked the guys up in his basement dr lorvis isn’t there something you want to say sure,Amy

1100,sure how many is that really true what’s this for well that’s fascinating i can’t wait to read it well i’d been thinking about a cellular automata approach to neuronal connectivity and i thought it might have some interesting applications to string theory it’s not a big deal i did you said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away that leaves two frogs sheldon we’re all scientists i helped out a fellow colleague you’re being petty boy i just can’t seem to get these scissors back together can you do it darn it there’s something in my eye and i need to sort these coins by size can you help penny i really want to eat this banana but it’s stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box sheldon it’s me what are you talking about sheldon open the door i just saw you oh hey it’s not a big deal i run tests like this on undergrads all the time if you fill out some paperwork at the university i can get you five dollars so what are we talking like ten bucks wow the store looks great that’s not true well except barnabas but he was on adderall how can i make this up to you one of us would have taken you in she did that to me too,Amy
1101,i just read about an experiment designed to see if you could make two people fall in love in a matter of hours and then they finish it off by staring into each other’s eyes for four minutes other than the fact that i had it that was a magical night no forget it that’s what i said before i knew it he pontificated his way right into my heart why i think we’re safe the two of us could do it what’s the first question oh then i choose a janitor ’cause i’m about to throw up sounds good did he say anything about the funeral well we’re the ones tagging along you pick oh so how do we start keep it down we’re working here we used the coordinates to locate the cities well if i don’t have a brother my father’s son is me and if i’m this man’s father then he’s my son the answer’s son so that’s the key to the door that’s it well to be fair we do all have advanced degrees,Amy
1102,we have some exciting news after a careful evaluation of our relationship we decided that the time was right to take a step forward let’s say it together yes thank you acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us for halloween we can dress him as a cobblestone that’s what i said it’s okay you made it we’re fine let’s forget about them and pick ourselves out a nice turtle oh how about this one up on the log well he’s barely moving he looks half dead but that’s not your fault like you we’re taking it ridiculously slow you’ll stay with me when he’s at comiccon or away for work what are you talking about you applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet and couldn’t be bothered to tell me of course not no one told you to poke the turtle’s face i’m surprised you even care if he likes you since you’re planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get sheldon i know the odds of you even going to mars are incredibly small but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever i would at least mention it before filling out the application and who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission anyway you could barely survive a tiny turtle bite you know what go to mars sheldon no forget it please don’t why do you even want to do this can’t you just tell me i think i’m gonna go home you know sheldon at any other time learning that you had plans to go live on mars would be a slow news day but a couple of hours ago we were getting a turtle and silly as it sounds i thought that meant something sure unless something better comes along what i want is for us to be planning our future together we’re on the same planet are you asking me to go to mars with you okay i suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting you know we could also be the first people to procreate on mars think about it if we had a family there our kids would be martians i guess we’ll have to make a new video together as a couple,Amy
1103,i’d say i’m sorry i asked except i didn’t oh let me see sheldon this article doesn’t mention leonard at all it only refers to dr cooper and his team did you even talk about him poor leonard he might not be think about it how would you feel if you were referred to as part of leonard’s team so you see what i’m getting at no try again leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are and he was overlooked he’s going to feel bad remember that time you didn’t get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at disneyland and they let that other kid do it exactly well that is an important part but leonard’s idea was good it’s not your fault not your fault hey look at that pretty bird do you need any help in the kitchen yes so please behave yourselves all these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight feels like we could be an th century french salon sheldon the view is a daytime talk show hosted by women ooh please do rajesh we won’t know if there’s equality until female thor has a baby and the avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work sheldon and girls i don’t hear it who cares did they mention leonard,Amy

1105,can you please pass the salt is this how the rest of the night’s going to be no sheldon according to the codicil of the relationship agreement which you insisted upon we’re not allowed to pout or be moody on date night well it applies to you too probably not it’s an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities being left out is a terrible feeling no one understands that better than i do when there was a lice epidemic at my school everybody got it except me i tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair but i just got attacked by bees and at the same time not you know there’s nothing i can do about getting you invited to the symposium but if you wanted we could build a fort more juvenile than this how’s it going sheldon can i come in amazing what are we doing this is a fort let’s sit on the floor i’d say knox over ticonderoga ’cause it’s got the gold and mcblanket over sumter ’cause it has a higher thread count oh ten o’clock date night’s over we both know this one’s gonna win come on i’ll help you take this down well as long as we’re suspending the parameters i could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover it’s a big fort pg some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers you got yourself a sleepover would it alarm you to know that i hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up who says this is the only one i hid yes they are okay have a seat on the floor,Amy
1106,i can’t believe you got up and walked out of an audition for a big movie and you probably have to invite your other friend ’cause she overheard you talking about it and it would be awkward to exclude her,Amy
1107,leonard have you ever given a high school commencement speech before i think it’s really nice that you’re sharing this experience with penny with a beautiful girl on your arm,Amy
1108,it’s so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award sure his mom gets roses when i want them they’re a bouquet of severed plant genitals he’s right roses die but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years do you think the moms will get along,Amy

1111,sheldon i don’t think you understand how being broken up works the only way i can sort through my feelings is if there is space between us every time i see you it retraumatizes me i go through the pain all over again what do you want what baby i’m hanging up sheldon i am not doing fun with flags with you because we’re broken up no one’s talking about sonny and cher sheldon this has to stop i know it’s hard it’s hard for me too but i’ve seen and talked to you more in the two days we’ve been broken up than in the last two months that we were together what are you doing here and you didn’t do your compulsive knocking ritual so i would open the door just give me the box fine my old scarf you mean the night that i went iceskating and you stood at the rail googling the symptoms of hypothermia whose bra is this it’s penny’s goodbye anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment come on you know leonard’s not like that that’s because you made him more confident i’m gonna kill him how dare you go on the internet and say mean things about me and compare my genitalia to part of czechoslovakia i don’t know what you were thinking but take the video down now i only watched it because you emailed it to me with the subject line this is gonna make you mad,Amy
1112,hi i know we’re not making a fuss but in the spirit of bachelorette parties i made cookies in the shape of male genitals thank you the veins are gummy worms i had extra dough boy that was a long night for me so penny how’s married life fine i guess i’ve been focusing on me i was thinking about changing my wardrobe but then i decided i don’t want to go changing who i am just because of some man actually i was thinking of making one small change piercing my ears my mom said pierced ears were for whores pirates and genies i know but sheldon had this clause in the relationship agreement forbidding cosmetic surgery unless it’s to look like a klingon really you have a piercing gun oh i don’t know you’re right i should probably let all of my facebook friends know penny i’m no longer in a relationship who why how long do you think you can keep it from him that wasn’t so bad nice boy if my mom could see me now she’d lock me in the sin closet actually the joke was on her i could still see the tv through the slats well it’s kind of sad that they don’t know i mean they love leonard uh well actually to be honest i haven’t told her yet i’m feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss i don’t know what you’re talking about easy for you to say you never had to watch minutes like this oh maybe later your pig dying made me sad and a little hungry okay okay fine hi mom you saw that huh hi mom how are you doing oh good how’s work that’s nice i’m fine hey listen i’ve been meaning to ask how come aunt doe and aunt florence never got along,Amy

1186,we’re so proud of you amy your first bikini wax really only five okay so did you spend last night hearing about this silly parking space fight too howard was so angry i had to mash up benadryl in his ice cream to get him to fall asleep i’m really sorry they took sheldon’s spot away he shouldn’t have to suffer just because howard’s such a big deal now what’s that supposed to mean you’re right and i’m sure sheldon will get a fancy parking spot again if and when he makes a worthwhile contribution to science hang on none of sheldon’s theories have ever been definitively proven my husband actually went to outer space gosh amy i’m sensing a little hostility is it maybe because like sheldon’s work your sex life is also theoretical i don’t have to take this i’m gonna go home and have sex with my husband right now maybe i’ll let him do it to me in the parking spot which sounds dirty but i didn’t mean it that way what can i tell ya she’s a big girl wherever you look there she is more coffee he’s not here what’s wrong oh no where was it parked that doesn’t make sense sheldon doesn’t have a spot was it maybe in howard’s spot well that doesn’t make sense either because i’m the one who had it towed didn’t see that one coming did ya are you okay don’t move i’ll get some ice here amy you think maybe this has gotten a little out of hand you hit her what did i do you were parked in howard’s spot sheldon doesn’t have a spot okay let’s go the tow truck didn’t scratch your car ‘cause i did it you know i’m kind of glad this happened,Bernadette
1187,i just put it in it’s gonna be a while you could die so dad have you done any fishing lately hey dad maybe you could take howard fishing sometime give you guys a chance to get to know each other better howie i think you’d have fun terrific my two favorite fellas gone fishin’ what thing oh that thing no i cancelled that thing how’s the poor thing okay amy i brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab this is proving really good for congestion but there’s a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid so if you take it happy thoughts this is a really good expectorant although some test subjects reported lactating uncontrollably when they heard music i don’t understand so you’ve just been lying to him i don’t mean to be judgy but this is the kind of thing lunatics do,Bernadette

1190,he’s not exhausting at all it’s cute how excited they are you should have seen howard sewing his costume all week for the convention when he was a little boy every couple months he would have to let his mom’s pants out i don’t mind it i think howie’s just in touch with his inner child although when he comes to bed in his batman pyjamas sometimes it feels like i’m touching his inner child i’ve never even read a comic book you guys i mean it’s such an important part of their lives maybe we should try reading some the comic book store isn’t far from here why are they staring we were looking for a recommendation about comic books what kind of comics do the guys like i don’t know there were a lot of pictures and one page only had the word brakkadoom so what’d you guys think it’s crazy they spend hours arguing about things that don’t even exist i don’t think it’s heavy it’s some sort of magic so only thor can lift it no let’s read it again you want some tea hold on who decides who’s worthy does the hammer decide leonard and sheldon have boxes of comics across the hall why don’t we go look at those well what if the hulk picked up thor while thor is holding the hammer then by the transitive property of picking things up hulk picked up the hammer no it’s not then red hulk must be worthy you don’t know his life,Bernadette
