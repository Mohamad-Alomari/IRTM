40,oh how about we compromise and go on the small world ride at disneyland,Leonard
41,sure i’m still figuring out the thermoacoustic expander,Leonard
42,we only have two months to deliver this to the air force because of you,Leonard
43,guys we’re not gonna get anything done if we start fighting now can you please try,Leonard
44,it’s been three and a half minutes wake up,Leonard

63,your problem,Leonard
64,is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem,Leonard
65,sheldon we are dealing with an impossible deadline from the air force because of you so have an energy drink don’t have an energy drink order suppositories and shove ’em wherever you want i don’t care,Leonard
66,right listen to me we can’t do anything until you do your part so get up in front of this whiteboard and do it,Leonard
67,yes you can,Leonard
68,seriously,Leonard
69,it’s okay we’ll figure something out,Leonard
70,it’ll be fine you’ll see sheldon buddy sheldon snores,Leonard

72,right sorry sir,Leonard
73,sir,Leonard

81,there goes our big payday,Leonard
82,you do that too,Leonard
83,are you crazy you can’t put that on snapchat,Leonard
84,that’s not a bad idea,Leonard

96,where did you go to school,Leonard
97,i don’t know how i feel about this,Leonard

108,i didn’t even have to take my glasses off,Leonard
109,you can do this,Leonard
110,this is an euler’s disk it’s a physics toy that demonstrates angular momentum potential energy and kinetic energy,Leonard
111,but raj is from india which means he’s no slouch at holding his breath,Leonard
112,how ya doing,Leonard
113,dig deep like when we bet you couldn’t fit into howard’s pants,Leonard

135,and you think we can get those guys to reprogram sheldon cool,Leonard
136,that a bunch of awkward scientists with no social skills would invent a machine to do it for them,Leonard
137,i was thinking maybe a library or a gaming room,Leonard
138,i don’t like trains you like trains,Leonard
139,well when you get the machine you can find out,Leonard

142,oh yeah okay sure what’s going on with your brother,Leonard
143,huh is that a good idea i mean you think they’ll consider someone who was in prison for selling drugs,Leonard
144,well i’m sure he’ll appreciate carrying his samples in a briefcase instead of his colon how long do you think he’ll stay,Leonard
145,hmm who knows that’s exciting i’ll get to wake up every morning and see if he’s still here,Leonard
146,of course not i mean he’s your brother,Leonard

155,i’m not saying you have to ask my permission but you could have talked to me about it before you said it was okay,Leonard
156,our gaming room i was gonna put a scented candle in it,Leonard
157,because i didn’t want to sound like a jerk,Leonard
158,if you get him a job he’s gonna live here forever,Leonard

174,fine go for a little walk,Leonard
175,just keep walking,Leonard
176,at least it’s quiet when he takes bathroom breaks,Leonard
177,you’re kidding,Leonard
178,you know i do have a way to get him out of our hair i’ve been holding onto this for a few years but maybe now’s the time,Leonard
179,you can’t kill him he’ll just respawn at the last save point,Leonard
180,hey uh buddy i got you a little present,Leonard
181,yeah go ahead open it,Leonard
182,okay where were we,Leonard
183,this train thing worked out better than i thought he’s home studying the engineer’s manual,Leonard
184,four thousand dollars worth every penny,Leonard
185,colonel williams sir,Leonard
186,as a cooling solution it’s pretty cool,Leonard
187,oh nothing just some math we don’t need,Leonard
188,it’s just a theory uh it’s not even worked out,Leonard
189,sir uh if i may uh we’ve put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype it’s a really elegant solution and most importantly it works,Leonard
190,oh boohoo i spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon what is that,Leonard
191,okay look sheldon the colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller and we can’t do it without you,Leonard
192,sheldon you can still go on the trip in a few weeks just help us out,Leonard
193,come on you know you’re not leaving physics why are you doing this,Leonard
194,okay this is everything he had on the board i’m sure we can figure the rest out,Leonard
195,oh we can get this is there any chance it’s upsidedown,Leonard
196,it’s classified if we tell anyone we’d get in trouble,Leonard
197,just keep thinking i got it,Leonard
198,no but when we show this nonsense to sheldon it will make him crazy and he’ll have to fix it,Leonard
199,yeah i know that’s not even a math symbol that’s just charlie brown’s hair,Leonard
200,well sheldon turns out we didn’t need you after all,Leonard
201,no,Leonard
202,aren’t you gonna look at the board to see how right we are,Leonard
203,just look at the board,Leonard
204,oh no what should we have done differently,Leonard
205,come on sheldon you can’t turn your back on physics and besides you have no idea what you’re doing with this stuff,Leonard
206,and instead of standing around watching you can help us build your smaller guidance system,Leonard
207,so what do you say,Leonard
208,what,Leonard
209,we’re not gonna be brothers we’re not gonna be stepbrothers go to sleep,Leonard
210,go to sleep,Leonard

249,yeah my record was six,Leonard
250,no don’t do that,Leonard
251,oh true but think of how much you’ve accomplished who got him to stop purelling his pocket change,Leonard

253,and who got him to try a turkey dog,Leonard
254,how can you stop now that’s like walking out of pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy,Leonard

292,i would like to keep the official flag of our apartment,Leonard
293,yeah i like this one,Leonard
294,but you made me order it because you were too wellknown in the flag community and they’d jack up the price,Leonard
295,oh i do the the field of blue represents you being miserable and the lion sticking its tongue out means i’m happy about it,Leonard

299,you’re good at revenge how do we get him back,Leonard
300,sheldon i know what you did now change the password back,Leonard
301,sheldon i’m warning you i can play this game too,Leonard
302,all right i tried,Leonard
303,hey,Leonard
304,separating my delicates,Leonard
305,no this is the level i am stooping to i believe that is flag to crotch four checkmate easypeasy ooh so breezy,Leonard

324,that stinks how long are you out of the apartment,Leonard
325,buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water can’t have your head shoved in a toilet as much as i did and not pick up a few things about plumbing,Leonard
326,and we live with sheldon so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning,Leonard
327,mmhmm for two of us it’s in the right direction,Leonard
328,it’s only for five weeks,Leonard
329,you just shaved yesterday you’re good for three months,Leonard
330,okay star trek the original series the enterprise was on a fiveyear mission to explore new worlds think of this as your personal fiveweek mission to do the same,Leonard
331,that’s a good question maybe just don’t come over,Leonard
332,just nod and smile he’s almost gone,Leonard
333,i’m trying to think of an answer that won’t stop you from doing this,Leonard
334,never leave a belt on the floor at night they look like snakes,Leonard
335,keep mm’s in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line,Leonard
336,he startles easily so please no flash photography,Leonard

368,well we had started bingewatching luke cage together and it was kind of our thing and then i find out that she watched two episodes without me,Leonard
369,oh yeah and you thought spock ears were only good for comiccon,Leonard
370,oh cool i’ll be like a pointyeared paul bunyan,Leonard
371,stupid idea,Leonard

738,anyway i figured i can hang out with my friends and have fun too,Leonard
739,oh it’s just nice to be with people who are happy to have me around isn’t that right halley,Leonard

741,a little until i saw them in matching tops,Leonard
742,well what am i supposed to say stop having fun without me,Leonard
743,i know but he was my friend first it’s like she’s stealing him and they’re just having the best time doing all their dumb girly stuff together,Leonard
744,you know it’s nice to spend time with people who don’t talk about work like it’s some kind of soap opera,Leonard
745,yeah,Leonard
746,i’m sure i’m overreacting,Leonard
747,i don’t want to sound like a jealous baby,Leonard
748,anyway i know it’s silly but since raj moved in i’ve been feeling a little left out,Leonard

751,thank you i…,Leonard
752,hey olsen twins…,Leonard
753,well i mean i’m sitting right here you’re talking about my feelings and somehow leaving me out of the conversation,Leonard
754,i don’t know you pretty much covered it,Leonard
755,uhhuh interesting okay,Sheldon
756,let me put it this way do you own a barrel and suspenders,Sheldon
757,i’m not wearing this visor to play women’s golf,Sheldon
758,well his rent and car lease are exceedingly high you couple that with his penchant for dining out and shopping,Sheldon
759,he also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt,Sheldon
760,what emergency happened at the la zoo,Sheldon
761,no absolutely not you can’t afford to hire someone who’ll forbid you from spending your money on foolish expenses that is a foolish expense and i forbid it,Sheldon
762,he sounds like a sociopath,Sheldon
763,you’re talking about me very funny although i would enjoy drawing up a budget and forcing raj to adhere to it without an ounce of compassion,Sheldon
764,very well hey comiccon tickets go on sale this friday you can’t buy one,Sheldon
765,she’s gonna hate waiting in line for the panels,Sheldon
766,she’s gonna hate the panels,Sheldon
767,you can always watch the panels online oh boy we do say that a lot,Sheldon
768,you put me in charge of your finances if you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over you should have asked leonard,Sheldon
769,your father may have spoiled you but i won’t if you want a ticket to comiccon i suggest you figure out a way to earn the money yourself,Sheldon
770,i’m gonna go as dumbledore,Sheldon
771,that’s probably my fault she may have heard about my cool dumbledore costume,Sheldon
772,if i may speak for comiccon we don’t want that either,Sheldon
773,no but it’s honest and it sounds like you could use a little more honesty in your relationship,Sheldon
774,i’m always honest with amy the other day she said she was selfconscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder and i said you know you can call that a beauty mark all you want when there’s hair growing out of it that’s a mole,Sheldon
775,i should hope so when she called me an insensitive jerk i’d like to think she meant it,Sheldon
776,very well prepare for a long night of deceit,Sheldon
777,i was talking about leonard and if make up is so truthful why is it called concealer,Sheldon
778,he doesn’t really want penny to go to comiccon he’s just doing it to make her happy,Sheldon
779,so they’re both trying to make each other happy and the end result is they make each other sad that’s hilarious i can’t wait to tell them,Sheldon
780,why,Sheldon
781,well if you haven’t noticed i’ve been between them for the last ten years,Sheldon
782,hello,Sheldon
783,are you listening to this they deceive each other about everything,Sheldon
784,this is an interesting way to stay out of it,Sheldon
785,yeah well get this neither does penny that’s why she doesn’t want to go you set ’em up i knock ’em down good job,Sheldon
786,not entirely the fight over who’s going to drive is still…,Sheldon
787,well with as much debt as you have probably not next year either,Sheldon
788,hold on is it back pay or is it a gift,Sheldon
789,when the irs questions us in separate rooms we need to have our stories straight,Sheldon
790,i’m a big boy and if i missed one i’d throw a bigboy tantrum,Sheldon
791,nuts to that i’m going to comiccon,Sheldon

854,hello,Sheldon
855,don’t sign anything that’s your advice okay so uh if during this meeting one of us were to say complete an oil painting you’d recommend that we leave that unsigned,Sheldon

865,hello,Sheldon
866,oh leonard’s mad at me so i’m making him lemon bars,Sheldon
867,not really but i’m mad at him too so lemon bars it is,Sheldon
868,they made me promise i wouldn’t talk,Sheldon
869,well now see you knew what was gonna happen why didn’t they anyway now we’re committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame and everyone’s upset with me,Sheldon
870,mm if it makes you feel any better a parasitoid wasp known as oobius depressus has been rediscovered after years of presumed extinction,Sheldon
871,why would your bernadette thing make me feel better at least mine was educational,Sheldon
872,look i’m sorry tell me why bernadette is upset with you,Sheldon
873,why would you do that,Sheldon
874,see that’s exactly what happened to me except that i said it on purpose and i have no regrets,Sheldon
875,i never realized this building was classified,Sheldon
876,the way you put away those lemon bars perhaps that’s a good thing,Sheldon
877,why it clearly doesn’t work,Sheldon
878,impressive,Sheldon
879,there’s no way,Sheldon
880,its weight and smoothness along with the slight concavity of the mirror means it can spin for a long time,Sheldon
881,kind of busy right now,Sheldon
882,he’s not gonna make it,Sheldon
883,you know deepsea divers holding their breath for several minutes have shown elevated markers of a protein that can signal brain damage,Sheldon
884,it’s slowing down,Sheldon
885,he’s not gonna make it,Sheldon
886,oh i won’t i only eat equilateral triangles isosceles isosceles oh scalene you didn’t see that,Sheldon
887,why,Sheldon
888,i have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise,Sheldon
889,if the judge couldn’t explain it to me i don’t see how you will,Sheldon
890,hello,Sheldon
891,well have a lovely evening,Sheldon

893,msn search altavista and ask jeeves you,Sheldon
894,bert i insist that you join us,Sheldon
895,not at all amy,Sheldon
896,well i could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad,Sheldon
897,you want me to look at him and listen to him,Sheldon
898,actually we met online,Sheldon
899,although unlike your date she actually showed up oh he looks sad again,Sheldon
900,no no i only told leonard howard raj kripke uh professor wu professor klein and a lunch lady in the cafeteria how everyone else found out is a mystery to me,Sheldon
901,why aren’t you talking to me,Sheldon
902,oh well now i’m sorry i asked,Sheldon
903,what is there to gossip about we barely have one,Sheldon
904,is it safe to assume you’re not speaking to me again if you’re not answering because you’re not speaking to me perhaps we could come up with a signal that works,Sheldon
905,well wait this is our first fight as a couple who live together,Sheldon
906,i’m not sure of the protocol television teaches us that the man’s supposed to sleep on the couch but of the two of us you’re clearly more sofasized,Sheldon
907,this isn’t fair you’ve discussed aspects of our physical relationship with penny,Sheldon
908,that lady has a name i don’t know what it is but one time i accidentally called her mom,Sheldon
909,knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy,Sheldon
910,not exactly the welcome wagon but i’ll take it,Sheldon
911,i’m mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed i call these circles zones of privacy don’t google that unless you want to see pictures of people’s genitals this circle contains only me and you it represents subjects we only share with each other details of physical intimacy bathroom habits although as i’m saying it i may need to add dr fink in here,Sheldon
912,no i was just excited to list him as a friend,Sheldon
913,i’m sorry you were embarrassed and now i understand that some things are just between you and me and in the event of redness and swelling dr fink,Sheldon
914,that’s reserved for thoughts i don’t share with anyone,Sheldon
915,of course,Sheldon
916,no they’re private,Sheldon
917,a little,Sheldon
918,fine two years ago i got my driver’s license,Sheldon
919,i like being chauffeured around it makes me feel important,Sheldon
920,no you didn’t but keep in mind i felt extremely important,Sheldon
921,excuse me may i have your attention please i have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with amy farrah fowler has become water cooler gossip and i just want to say shame on all of you we’re scientists our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge not the intimate details of other people’s lives,Sheldon
922,thank you bert you’re a good man that woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out,Sheldon
923,oh oh i’m sorry correction that woman not only had vigorous coitus with bert she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done – that better,Sheldon
924,all right well to sum up focus on science keep your nose out of other people’s business and uh whoa for a good time call bert,Sheldon
925,well last night amy was angry with me because i’d been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters,Sheldon
926,oh i know that now at first i thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps but it turns out no she was genuinely mortified,Sheldon
927,that’s not a problem we can figure this out what are the reasons women reject raj,Sheldon
928,doesn’t like games that’s one,Sheldon
929,of course you’re fine not every member of a species finds a mate sir isaac newton died a virgin look at the contributions he made,Sheldon
930,so now you think you’re better than isaac newton oh no wonder women don’t like you,Sheldon
931,what he said he was fine,Sheldon
932,oh that’s a paradox i mean if you meant what you just said then that means you may not have meant what you just said,Sheldon
933,well i thought we were having a nice conversation but it turns out i was being offensive,Sheldon
934,yeah,Sheldon
935,we were discussing raj’s recent breakup and apparently i was insensitive to him,Sheldon
936,don’t fall for it he’ll get you to compare him to a dead virgin and suddenly you’re the bad guy,Sheldon
937,then why didn’t you say that,Sheldon
938,well i would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind,Sheldon
939,well it certainly would be easier you have no idea what it’s like to struggle with recognizing emotional cues,Sheldon
940,thank you,Sheldon
941,okay now you’re just showing off,Sheldon
942,a machine that reads emotions is intriguing it could help me be a more considerate friend,Sheldon
943,it could also help me identify my enemies discover their fears and then i could use those fears to destroy them,Sheldon
944,you could make it a train room,Sheldon
945,i know and amy says i can’t have a train room,Sheldon
946,wonderful although i’m not sure how i feel about being used as a guinea pig,Sheldon
947,yes now when the robots rise up they’ll know that i’ve been rooting for them the whole time,Sheldon
948,you are happy,Sheldon
949,aw somebody’s ignoring their tiny needle teeth but all right,Sheldon
950,sad,Sheldon
951,oh that makes sense ’cause she’s gone and you miss her,Sheldon
952,and you’re worried that turkey neck is in your future what now see now it says you’re mad make up your mind,Sheldon
953,hey leonard if you’re happy and you know it no need to clap your hands because i have an emotion detector,Sheldon
954,surprisingly well,Sheldon
955,no wait uh hold on oh what you are aren’t you sweet,Sheldon
956,oh ooh and that makes leonard angry,Sheldon
957,what leonard please i know an angry face when i see it it’s this red frowny guy on my phone,Sheldon
958,yes,Sheldon
959,it’s like you’re twins,Sheldon
960,well hey now she’s angry too this thing works like gangbusters,Sheldon
961,he’s still mad,Sheldon
962,you first,Sheldon
963,hey i shared my honey nut cheerios with you,Sheldon
964,you are lucky that this feelings machine doesn’t have feelings,Sheldon
965,gladly can we storm out,Sheldon
966,fine i’ll just give them the finger,Sheldon
967,not really,Sheldon
968,i wish i never tried that device and i know i said the same thing after the massage chair but this time i mean it,Sheldon
969,it’s more than that it’s me i always knew i had trouble recognizing other people’s emotions but that machine just made it so real,Sheldon
970,i thought i was getting better at it but clearly i’m not,Sheldon
971,yeah but that’s shooting fish in a barrel you’re kind of a sad sack i’m sorry i shouldn’t have said that i’m just upset,Sheldon
972,i feel the same way about you now put your glasses back on you look weird,Sheldon
973,yes,Sheldon
974,oh it’s fine you needed a suitcase i wasn’t home you borrowed a suitcase,Sheldon
975,oh well i thought we were going in order,Sheldon
976,yeah well you should be your socks were still in it i had to throw it away anyway i uh trust that you’ve resolved your conflict,Sheldon
977,uh guys it sounds like you’re getting angry again,Sheldon
978,yes i don’t need an emotion machine i am one,Sheldon
979,i did you know i’m not even sure how accurate it was i took it to the train store it said everyone was sad,Sheldon
980,hey uh bernadette let’s test this theory what do you think i’m feeling right now,Sheldon
981,keep filling this one with babies she’s good,Sheldon
982,gentlemen we need to stop immediately,Sheldon
983,i’m looking at the math and i think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller,Sheldon
984,shame on you where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude i’ll tell you we would have the standard and the miniature poodle but no toy or teacup which by the way is not an officially recognized breed but that’s just poodle politics,Sheldon
985,fine candy bars now do you enjoy a fun size i know you do,Sheldon
986,i don’t want to go home,Sheldon
987,then what,Sheldon
988,oh that was my sixth trip to the bathroom as long as that’s not a urinary tract infection that’s a personal best,Sheldon
989,really,Sheldon
990,congratulations the bearer of this certificate is entitled to the ultimate train experience at the nevada northern railway you are at the throttle you are the engineer you are running the locomotive this doesn’t happen very often but here comes a hug oh dear i have to tinkle again,Sheldon
991,you’ll never believe it leonard gave me the most incredible gift a trip to a historic railway and i get to operate an actual locomotive,Sheldon
992,no idea all i know is i’m gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day,Sheldon
993,oh no it’s not just me no the railway is four hours from the nearest airport and guess who gets to drive me,Sheldon
994,you,Sheldon
995,oh oh and guess where we get to sleep our choice of a turnofthecentury railway bunkhouse or a working caboose now the problem with a caboose is there’s no bathroom but the problem with the bunkhouse is it’s not a caboose on the first day i get to drive a steam engine oh and the second day a diesel engine oh and if i volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork they’ll let me stay as long as i want so you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives,Sheldon
996,oh get this i get to take a test based on a page manual i get to learn things like hand signals ooh there’s forward uh reverse set the brakes are you done yet you’re missing,Sheldon
997,oh hey if you knocked i couldn’t hear you i’m welding this locomotive engine and if you didn’t knock how about some manners,Sheldon
998,i said to myself i think i can i think i can and then i couldn’t so i paid two men who promised not to come rob us later,Sheldon
999,interesting well so i was right,Sheldon
1000,well i would love to help you but since i discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine i don’t think i can go back to theory i’m an engineer now and hey just to be clear a train engineer not that goofy kind you are,Sheldon
1001,sorry i need to work on this engine so when i get to the train yard i won’t look foolish,Sheldon
1002,leonard in the world of theoretical physics you never finish so much is unprovable but when i was studying that railway guide it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked then it clacked then it clicked then it clacked clickclack clicketyclack and here we are whoowhoo,Sheldon
1003,well good for you guys look i have a grease smudge on my hand and i’m okay with it,Sheldon
1004,no thanks i’m busy trying to fix this fuel pump,Sheldon
1005,oh well i guess it’s fixed,Sheldon
1006,that’s wrong,Sheldon
1007,well first of all you can’t use relativistic and nonrelativistic vectors in the same equation,Sheldon
1008,okay but this is the last time nice try blockheads,Sheldon
1009,excuse me i have a girlfriend i’m already king of the train store,Sheldon
1010,oh what choice do i have you need me i’m like the crankshaft of this team,Sheldon
1011,well whatever it is it looks heavy i’m gonna need you two to get it downstairs before amy comes home,Sheldon

1014,may i borrow your water,Sheldon
1015,the light’s green,Sheldon
1016,gps says we’ll be at the railway in three hours,Sheldon
1017,leonard leonard,Sheldon
1018,you realize you and i could become brothers,Sheldon
1019,i hope you’re right ‘cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother’s wife is weird,Sheldon
1020,okay do you think your father’s doing unspeakable things to my mother,Sheldon
1021,are you saying that because the things are unspeakable,Sheldon
1022,very well,Sheldon
1023,hey if you want me to sleep you’re gonna have to stop talking,Sheldon
1024,it was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example,Sheldon
1025,whuh are we still doing the dumb thing okay why what’s wrong,Sheldon
1026,oh golly however did he humiliate you,Sheldon
1027,do i say stop what or just throw in the towel,Sheldon
1028,oh excuse me that is my mother you’re talking about however accurately,Sheldon
1029,and turned their phones off,Sheldon
1030,you know also if they did have coitus we’ll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist,Sheldon
1031,all right so less or equally awkward got it,Sheldon
1032,hello,Sheldon
1033,so did you defile my mother or not,Sheldon
1034,did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold,Sheldon
1035,or what a joy it is to behold my genitals,Sheldon
1036,a man named jesus convinced you to build a church in africa you’re kind of a sucker,Sheldon
1037,what in the chattahoochee national forest in georgia i can’t be the only one that knows that’s halfway,Sheldon
1038,what but he’s a mediocre academic and according to beverley his sexual prowess is subpar he’s basically leonard with a bigger prostate,Sheldon
1039,yes while also getting in a solid dig at you pretty efficient huh,Sheldon
1040,but why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents,Sheldon
1041,great now i have to start all over,Sheldon
1042,you made god sad today mom,Sheldon
1043,well that’s still no reason to rush into anything i mean look at us we took things remarkably slow you and i we didn’t even hold hands for two years,Sheldon
1044,hey hey she’s mine take a cold shower grandpa,Sheldon
1045,why do people cry at weddings,Sheldon
1046,speaking of love stds among the elderly are skyrocketing,Sheldon
1047,yeah excuse me i need to say something to someone pretty special and i just can’t wait any longer,Sheldon
1048,leonard you and i have our ups and downs but i have always considered you my family even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits i don’t always show it but you are of great importance to me both of you,Sheldon
1049,plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy,Sheldon
1050,yes ma’am,Sheldon
1051,well and you need to drive the car and mind your business,Sheldon
1052,what you’re not my mother,Sheldon
1053,yes ma’am,Sheldon
1054,will you two please inform amy how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule,Sheldon
1055,i can if you’d just roll over and accept your fate,Sheldon
1056,oh look who’s in favour of compromise the woman who married leonard hofstadter,Sheldon
1057,well i’m open to that,Sheldon
1058,i think we should see other people,Sheldon
1059,well as a male i have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my dna restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature,Sheldon
1060,don’t blame me blame your pal biology he’s the pervert pulling the strings here,Sheldon
1061,you know people are quick to accuse me of being difficult to live with but the truth is amy is just as challenging,Sheldon
1062,yes,Sheldon
1063,yes,Sheldon
1064,when we’re sleeping she breathes on me one night it got so bad i almost grabbed toto,Sheldon
1065,she’s always complaining about people at work,Sheldon
1066,do you know that when i get out of the shower she eyes me up and down like i’m a piece of meat,Sheldon
1067,i know sometimes i would just like to be appreciated for my mind,Sheldon
1068,have you noticed it’s always an aflat,Sheldon
1069,if we’re just going to drive around aimlessly the least you could do is take me for ice cream,Sheldon
1070,well see why can’t amy be that subservient she has coitus one time suddenly she’s gloria steinem anyway i suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women,Sheldon
1071,being with amy has awoken the sexual creature within when i see a pretty gal walking down the street i think hubba hubba like any other guy,Sheldon
1072,no no if we both like it i’ll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going aw no strawberry,Sheldon
1073,hmm well she spends her whole day scooping one arm’s probably bigger than the other,Sheldon
1074,you are truly wise,Sheldon
1075,i’d say wise beyond your years but you’re getting up there,Sheldon
1076,penny i am going to tell you a story that i’ve never told anyone,Sheldon
1077,i was years old and on spring break from college,Sheldon
1078,i came home early because they ran out of math to teach me,Sheldon
1079,my mother was at bible study i walked in the house expecting to find it empty and i heard a sound coming from my parents’ bedroom when i opened the door i saw my father having relations with another woman,Sheldon
1080,i know it’s also why i never open a door without knocking three times i mean the first,Sheldon
1081,we locked eyes i ran to my room and we never ever spoke of it,Sheldon
1082,since amy and i have been living together we’ve been bickering like my parents used to,Sheldon
1083,yes i need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road,Sheldon
1084,well anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone,Sheldon
1085,i’m sure you’re right i suppose i should apologize to you as well,Sheldon
1086,that must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you please understand that i think of you as more of a nanny,Sheldon
1087,hello,Sheldon
1088,i wanted to apologize for my behaviour today it it was unnecessary this is warm oh and also i am willing to forego the bathroom schedule,Sheldon
1089,amy you should know i was never really interested in seeing other women and to prove how serious i am about us i’m willing to take our relationship to the next level,Sheldon
1090,amy farrah fowler will you share this toothbrush holder with me,Sheldon
1091,amy wake up,Sheldon
1092,it’s midnight happy birthday,Sheldon
1093,this is for you i was going to wrap it but touching scotch tape gives me the heebiejeebies,Sheldon
1094,a functional mri of my brain i did sudoku before they took it so i’d be ripped,Sheldon
1095,and it’s not just an mri the orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because i was thinking of you,Sheldon
1096,we seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities,Sheldon
1097,i didn’t put on my comehither plaid pj’s for nothing,Sheldon
1098,yeah i’m afraid so childbirth looming coitus this is a banner night for female genitals,Sheldon
1099,wolowitz might hand out cigars i had to find my bubble gum cigar so i could join in without looking foolish,Sheldon
1100,i’m starting to rethink the flash onesie i bought this kid,Sheldon
1101,it doesn’t matter what i want it’s your birthday you decide,Sheldon
1102,that’s a bit childish isn’t it,Sheldon
1103,grape i find it the most mild,Sheldon
1104,well i believe we were kissing like randy teenagers and your nose was whistling ever so slightly,Sheldon
1105,oh don’t be you were like a foxy tea kettle,Sheldon
1106,very well,Sheldon
1107,i’m not sure earlier tonight things began organically and now it’s feeling forced like all the pirates of the caribbean sequels,Sheldon

1109,no and also i don’t want to disappoint you i you know come on it’s your birthday i can soldier through this,Sheldon
1110,intriguing is back on track a hint that it has something to do with trains,Sheldon
1111,because if it did have to do with trains and you were gonna give…,Sheldon
1112,not even a cozy sleeper car on the orient express,Sheldon
1113,who’s killing the mood now,Sheldon
1114,can i look yet,Sheldon

1116,what a gryffindor sleeping with a hufflepuff how scandalous you naughty girl you went to the wizarding world theme park without me,Sheldon
1117,yes you’re in trouble you went to wizarding world without me,Sheldon
1118,you know i’ve been wanting to go,Sheldon
1119,oh you’re right i’m sorry,Sheldon
1120,five minutes we must be doing it wrong it took us hours,Sheldon
1121,she’s right you know i just learned amy went to a theme park without me but i’m not going to ruin her birthday i’ll wait and ruin individual hours sprinkled throughout the year boop,Sheldon
1122,but if my mom asks we have bunk beds,Sheldon
1123,i was not thinking it although now that you point it out it is undeniable,Sheldon
1124,raj show some compassion those are things that we think but don’t say,Sheldon
1125,oh speaking of personal growth i recently tried eating swiss chard you know i didn’t swallow it but amy said it counted,Sheldon
1126,some will be successful some may be homeless it’s fun to think about,Sheldon
1127,it was bernadette had her baby i made it to wizarding world and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration hankius pankius,Sheldon
1128,amy i just saw a magic train and reported somebody for cutting the line if that’s not foreplay i don’t know what is,Sheldon
1129,oh actually i would,Sheldon
1130,let’s take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here,Sheldon
1131,you know i have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building,Sheldon
1132,you know i wonder how she feels about all this artwork,Sheldon
1133,it truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with penny,Sheldon
1134,yeah it seems only right that she have it back,Sheldon
1135,look it’s the same smile she has in the painting,Sheldon
1136,yeah there’s hooks in the closet i can hang it right now,Sheldon
1137,what happened to them,Sheldon
1138,you know leonard the more i think about it there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and i should go through uh for example who gets our beloved sword longclaw,Sheldon
1139,that seems fair we did just give you the painting,Sheldon
1140,wonderful longclaw is mine and how about you keep our avocado plant,Sheldon
1141,although amy and i did just move in together and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift,Sheldon
1142,oh we got a sword and a plant our apartment’s really shaping up,Sheldon
1143,oh remember when we got this at comiccon,Sheldon
1144,it’s one of a kind,Sheldon
1145,well leonard you know who should keep this on the one hand i love mr spock more than you do on the other hand i care more about clocks than you do,Sheldon
1146,i’ll be right across the hall you’ll probably be able to hear it,Sheldon
1147,thank you,Sheldon
1148,oh now what about our d chess set,Sheldon
1149,well no i just didn’t think you’d want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win as a kindness i should probably take all the games,Sheldon
1150,are you sure these items represent our shared times together,Sheldon
1151,for a man so good at predicting my moves how come you stink at d chess,Sheldon
1152,it’s not my fault i’m bad at sharing i skipped kindergarten,Sheldon
1153,yeah take whatever you want,Sheldon
1154,but you don’t even like flags,Sheldon
1155,but i designed it,Sheldon
1156,but you don’t even understand its symbolism,Sheldon
1157,come along amy i know when i’m not wanted,Sheldon
1158,well powder me in sugar and call me a doughnut if it isn’t leonard hofstadter,Sheldon
1159,if it’s like your d chess game then you’re out of your length width and depth amy get the neosporin somebody just got burned,Sheldon
1160,all right i tried that should be the title of your autobiography ooh a seconddegree burn,Sheldon
1161,it’s a good thing you’re cute,Sheldon
1162,what do you think you’re doing,Sheldon
1163,this is the level you’re stooping to,Sheldon
1164,so there are fresh linens on the bed and oh well now i see you’ve met theodore theodore these are your new room mates leonard and penny they’re very honest but i would not leave cash lying around,Sheldon
1165,my room is paid up until the end of the month so i can do with it whatever i please which includes renting it out for a dollar a night,Sheldon
1166,anyway i’ll leave you be i have to oh oh he’s expecting a newspaper in the morning apparently they still make them,Sheldon
1167,that’s true but had i done something under the line there wouldn’t be a man in your kitchen who can’t produce a single form of id,Sheldon
1168,and now you know as much about him as i do,Sheldon
1169,will you keep it down what kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think i’m running,Sheldon
1170,i’m being awful you’re the one who went out of your way to hurt me,Sheldon
1171,dividing our belongings is difficult,Sheldon
1172,i have to admit leaving you to move in with amy has been harder than i thought it would be,Sheldon
1173,leonard i would like us to stop fighting about our possessions,Sheldon
1174,in fact i want you to keep the apartment flag and i’m not just saying that because it touched your genitals,Sheldon
1175,i do and to show you that there are no hard feelings i am willing to rub my genitals on it as well,Sheldon
1176,why are you all smiling like crazy people,Sheldon
1177,cohabitation with my girlfriend that’s a great deal to process,Sheldon
1178,i don’t know what if living together kills the romance,Sheldon
1179,yeah but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain i mean she’s never even seen me unshaven,Sheldon
1180,don’t try luring me in with sexy talk,Sheldon
1181,if you want to lure me in with sexy talk that’s how you do it,Sheldon
1182,not yet how will i learn if i’m comfortable living with amy or just comfortable because i’m in my own apartment now if this experiment is going to be valid i suggest a neutral environment,Sheldon
1183,well ideally an enclosed selfsustaining biodome in new mexico where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste,Sheldon
1184,interesting if my official residence were across the hall i wonder if i’d need to knock every time i came over here,Sheldon
1185,historically i don’t do well with change,Sheldon
1186,you’re darn right you wouldn’t no matter where i am this will always be my spot like an embassy in a foreign country this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom,Sheldon
1187,very well i’m on board,Sheldon
1188,yes i accept this fiveweek mission to share a living space with my girlfriend,Sheldon
1189,well now don’t be surprised if like star trek it’s cancelled in three,Sheldon
1190,oh thank you,Sheldon
1191,of course the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical sheldons and amys one pair that was neither dating nor living together one pair that was dating but not living together one pair that was living together but not dating and then of course one pair that was living together and dating although with that many sheldons it’d be such a party we’d never get anything done,Sheldon
1192,well you’ve lived with your significant other for some time i would like this experiment to go well are there any insights you can share,Sheldon
1193,you know leonard and i were very happy before you came along,Sheldon
1194,how many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move,Sheldon
1195,you truly are the goofus to my gallant,Sheldon
1196,oh excited concerned a little scared all the same emotions i feel in line at space mountain,Sheldon
1197,okay talk,Sheldon
1198,wow no foreplay or anything just right to it,Sheldon
1199,you’re really okay with that,Sheldon
1200,this is such a relief honestly if it didn’t get you all worked up i’d kiss you right now,Sheldon
1201,i know they probably shouldn’t sell those to children,Sheldon
1202,enjoy having the place to yourselves,Sheldon
1203,it’s penny’s bedroom plenty of men have gone before,Sheldon
1204,i guess this is it,Sheldon
1205,you too oh don’t forget tuesday the air filters need to be changed,Sheldon
1206,oh oh and every other day check the water level on the avocado pit,Sheldon
1207,leonard please let me go,Sheldon
1208,oh bye,Sheldon
1209,i guess the experiment begins,Sheldon
1210,which side of the bed would you prefer,Sheldon
1211,no no we’re living together now everything’s equal you know i know that i have a tendency to be controlling so i would rather you choose,Sheldon
1212,well clearly it’s not whatever i want because what i want is for you to make this decision and you refuse to do that,Sheldon
1213,like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom and then watched me roll right into traffic,Sheldon
1214,fine okay now on this side i am closer to the exit in case of emergency,Sheldon
1215,no but i’m also closer to the entrance in case of attack,Sheldon
1216,ah then again what are the odds of someone attacking me,Sheldon
1217,now this side offers me proximity to the bathroom but i am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep,Sheldon
1218,i suppose that works,Sheldon
1219,although now i’m kind of worried someone’s hiding behind those drapes,Sheldon
1220,be grateful i’m still in the room,Sheldon
1221,oh i’m just happy i don’t know what this memory foam remembers,Sheldon
1222,well it’s funny you should ask because i was wondering how you’d feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall,Sheldon
1223,okay well i am sorry i’m just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night and no offence but your bottom radiates enough heat i’m surprised there aren’t iguanas lying on it,Sheldon
1224,no dr feynman if i solve it for you you’ll never learn,Sheldon
1225,what are you doing down there,Sheldon
1226,who are you calling aaargh,Sheldon
1227,good morning see i didn’t knock but it’s fine i didn’t knock but it’s fine i didn’t knock but it’s fine so how is everyone,Sheldon
1228,really i slept great,Sheldon
1229,how you had the whole floor to yourself,Sheldon
1230,well but what kind of scientists would we be drawing a conclusion after only hours of data,Sheldon
1231,wow i anticipated we’d have problems but i never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them,Sheldon
1232,if the lab room disposable shoe cover fits,Sheldon
1233,how dare you,Sheldon
1234,whoa whoa now you’re making fun of my bona fides,Sheldon
1235,well if you are so protective of the scientific method perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started,Sheldon
1236,for science maybe you should,Sheldon
1237,fine,Sheldon
1238,great,Sheldon
1239,does stephen hawking roll through the quad,Sheldon
1240,hello,Sheldon
1241,oh you know the lone star state hmm that should be its yelp rating,Sheldon
1242,yeah it is good to be home oh good lord is that mistletoe don’t you maniacs own a calendar,Sheldon
1243,it was fine other than the weirdtasting juice amy gave me i slept the whole way,Sheldon
1244,well we were on our way to my mother’s house…,Sheldon
1245,how did we get in the car,Sheldon
1246,do we have to i really don’t want to hear the religious lecture,Sheldon
1247,there’s always one she gave it to my sister about her boyfriend my brother about his girlfriend my father about his girlfriend that one had some unchristian words in it,Sheldon
1248,eh i don’t know i am her precious little boy and you did take my flower,Sheldon
1249,anyway…,Sheldon
1250,given that your hands prepared it isn’t that a little selfserving,Sheldon
1251,welcome to texas,Sheldon
1252,oh wait wait shouldn’t we just eat you know i mean god did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these sloppy joes,Sheldon
1253,all right this is on you amy and i are living together in sin like a couple of new yorkers now while you scold us i’m going to get a knife and a fork joe may be sloppy but sheldon’s not,Sheldon
1254,what wh where’s the judgment wh where’s the fire and brimstone where’s the part where you tell us we’re going to hell and i say have you seen the size of the bugs outside we’re already there,Sheldon
1255,and what special circumstances are those,Sheldon
1256,what so you thought i was going to be alone for the rest of my life,Sheldon
1257,well this is highly insulting,Sheldon
1258,i’m the child she was worried about i have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldn’t power a potato clock if i spotted them the potato,Sheldon
1259,well i was in my room i couldn’t hear what they were saying,Sheldon
1260,just being the unsocialised eccentric my mother always thought i was,Sheldon
1261,yeah and i don’t understand why you’re taking her side by being my girlfriend she’s saying you’re a weirdo too,Sheldon
1262,and,Sheldon
1263,can you believe my mother thinks we’re both strange,Sheldon
1264,well first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off and then we went out,Sheldon
1265,you’re right i have leonard and howard and raj stuart penny leonard’s mom bernadette wil wheaton…,Sheldon
1266,i was going chronologically you’re right between koothrappali’s father and omar the oneeyed sparkletts guy,Sheldon
1267,i knew we should’ve never mentioned us living together in the first place,Sheldon
1268,disagree we’ve known about evolution since she still believes in noah and his amazing zoo boat this could have all been avoided if you’d only listened to me,Sheldon
1269,why would you do that,Sheldon
1270,you managed the situation,Sheldon
1271,so my mother thought i was incapable of finding a mate and my mate thinks i’m incapable of running my own life,Sheldon
1272,i have gotten much better at that,Sheldon
1273,what how should i know excited itchy give me the first letter,Sheldon
1274,how would you feel if i contacted your mother behind your back,Sheldon
1275,delighted what not if i guessed for a hundred years,Sheldon
1276,yeah here i’ll catch you up,Sheldon
1277,how did we get in the car,Sheldon
1278,i was acting odd intentionally,Sheldon
1279,well there’s really not much left to tell i decided that my mother views me as a child because i never went through a rebellious phase so i got an earring flashback to sheldon screaming my mother made me take it out flashback to sheldon screaming amy put alcohol on it flashback to sheldon screaming and here we are,Sheldon
1280,i don’t understand what’s wrong with socks,Sheldon
1281,so bernadette if i express interest in your baby will you promise not to make me touch it,Sheldon
1282,hey how’s life with your baby,Sheldon
1283,to this day i’ve never touched stuart,Sheldon
1284,wait so how does the story end is the baby a jerk or is bernadette a bad mother,Sheldon
1285,what is there another twist coming is the baby not theirs at all,Sheldon
1286,it says here that up to of new mothers experience baby blues and that the best thing to do is reassure them that they’re doing a good job bernadette you are doing a good job,Sheldon
1287,thank you internet i’m telling you with the right youtube video i can give howard a vasectomy,Sheldon
1288,oh a small human wreaks havoc on his wife’s genitals and he gets time off,Sheldon
1289,we have people over all the time we have the maintenance people the pizza delivery man that ups driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging,Sheldon
1290,all right fine let’s say that we were to entertain people what type of gathering did you have in mind huh a meal lunch brunch dinner afternoon tea a formal tea hmm is it a party and if so what kind of party is it a cocktail party a tupperware party ooh is it a surprise party oh i hope it’s not a west coast party ’cause according to the man on the radio a west coast party don’t stop,Sheldon
1291,oh don’t be you get your hopes up i knock them down that’s called teamwork,Sheldon
1292,you expressed an interest in having people over and i feel i dismissed it too quickly so i took matters into my own hands and i arranged a brunch,Sheldon
1293,oh uh stuart bert from the geology lab and mrs petrescu from downstairs,Sheldon
1294,yes oh fun story she grew up with ten siblings or possibly penguins her english is atrocious,Sheldon
1295,well for our first time hosting i thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run you know like how i practiced for that halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station,Sheldon
1296,you never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station,Sheldon
1297,oh well the real surprise is how surprised you are that i’m great at surprises,Sheldon
1298,don’t get me all randy guests are on the way,Sheldon
1299,the average cork speed is miles per hour if that is too fast around a school it is certainly too fast around a kitchen,Sheldon
1300,okay i can do this just give me a moment… oh mimosas coming up,Sheldon
1301,would you like one mrs petrescu,Sheldon
1302,she’s learning english from tv,Sheldon

1306,you know exactly we’ve never thrown a brunch before and i wanted to work out all the kinks,Sheldon
1307,hmm you see your words sound reasonable but your face looks angry help me out here this is not where i shine,Sheldon
1308,okay now see you look sincere but your words are completely false i’m glad we did this test run these brunches are wild,Sheldon
1309,oh thank you,Sheldon
1310,well no that’s not true i mean sometimes it’s koothrappali but we’re not supposed to say that ’cause he’s a minority,Sheldon
1311,stuart wait i do know what it feels like to be left out,Sheldon
1312,all right this is about me and him you’re not part of it stuart perhaps we do take you for granted and that is not acceptable please know that you truly are a valuable member of our social group,Sheldon
1313,you know in fact i’d like to propose a toast to stuart a fine man a good friend and a wonderful guest,Sheldon
1314,do you know what else i love about you,Sheldon

1326,so let’s roll up our sleevis and get to know nevis drumroll well i i like that but next time check with me,Sheldon
1327,buda and pest united to form budapest and that’s why budapest is the budabest now,Sheldon
1328,thank you for your services gentlemen now i’m hoping to broaden our audience with your youthful rock and roll music,Sheldon
1329,yeah we could get thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress,Sheldon
1330,so,Sheldon
1331,i am terrified of stepping on a nail and falling into a butt crack,Sheldon
1332,you know if you’d like i could call your landlord and complain,Sheldon
1333,oh i don’t mind i’m very good at complaining if it were an olympic sport i’d complain about what a stupid sport it is and then i’d take home the gold,Sheldon
1334,is it me or are you purposely changing the subject,Sheldon
1335,i have a feeling you’re still doing it but i find that topic irresistible so now in ancient mesopotamia the king referred to the people as his property,Sheldon
1336,i’m concerned about amy she’s acting a bit odd lately,Sheldon
1337,her behaviour no i have the feeling that she’s hiding something,Sheldon
1338,well whatever it is it’s troubling me and i can’t eat i can’t sleep and don’t even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements,Sheldon
1339,why would she keep something from me you know i shared my body with that woman and my netflix password they recommended stella got her groove back because of her,Sheldon
1340,i don’t understand,Sheldon
1341,so she’s deceiving me in order to spend more time with me,Sheldon
1342,oh well i feel both flattered and hurt like when people say i look like that skeleton from nightmare before christmas,Sheldon
1343,well i won’t tolerate deception in my relationship i have no choice but to confront her,Sheldon
1344,your klingon wordoftheday calendar’s gone,Sheldon
1345,it’s khoovakh,Sheldon
1346,no no he’s over there,Sheldon
1347,are you going to confront penny,Sheldon
1348,hmm you know perhaps instead of confronting them we should see how far they’re willing to spin their tangled webs like that spiderman action figure that used to be on your desk,Sheldon
1349,excellent i’m very hungry speaking of which what’s going on with your apartment,Sheldon
1350,interesting very interesting,Sheldon
1351,wait uh you saw her apartment,Sheldon

1368,of course there’s there’s always your apartment,Sheldon
1369,i hate your apartment,Sheldon
1370,well i suppose we could find a whole new place you know and technically we don’t even have to stay in pasadena we could we could move to altadena or a place that doesn’t even end in dena,Sheldon
1371,but what if we move and we don’t like it what if there’s a smoker in the building or pets or there could be mould there could be traffic noise i’m gonna have to learn a whole new bus route are you trying to soothe me by singing the star trek theme as a lullaby,Sheldon
1372,i’m not a child don’t do that,Sheldon
1373,i’m struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom,Sheldon
1374,i need to see it while i’m gone don’t breathe on my pillow,Sheldon
1375,that’s my girl what on earth what is going on,Sheldon
1376,no,Sheldon
1377,can we just focus on the decision i’m facing,Sheldon

1445,the theory is that if you really tax your brain the neurofibers will become thicker and the glial cells more lustrous,Sheldon

1534,and welcome to a special retrospective where we will take a look back at the history of fun with flags on an episode we’re calling…,Sheldon
1535,mind you when we say behind the flags we don’t literally mean these flags that’s just where we have dinner,Sheldon
1536,so let’s hear from some people who were there at the very start how howard flashback sounds,Sheldon
1537,just roll the clip on voiceover so tell us in your own words about that magical moment when fun with flags was born,Sheldon
1538,sure you do i was telling you both the story about how haiti and lichtenstein discovered they had the same flag it was at the summer olympics of and two plucky nations…,Sheldon
1539,oh and do you remember what you said,Sheldon
1540,and that’s exactly what i did i found a lot of someones,Sheldon
1541,and now we’re going to turn it over to you the viewers to call in and share your favourite fun with flags moments,Sheldon
1542,hello bert what is your flagrelated comment or query,Sheldon
1543,bert you’re tying up the line my apologies to all of you trying to call in with legitimate flag comments,Sheldon
1544,where’s howard,Sheldon
1545,oh let’s take advantage of his absence and tell the kinds of jokes only physicists get i’ll go first okay here uh heisenberg is pulled over by a police officer and the policeman says did you know you were going miles per hour and heisenberg says darn it now i don’t know where i am,Sheldon
1546,oh hello,Sheldon
1547,ahahah he’s a geologist and i have more physics jokes,Sheldon
1548,yeah which he rudely announced on my flag show people were so upset about it no one else called in the rest of the night,Sheldon
1549,hold on we don’t know anything about this woman,Sheldon
1550,is she a geologist,Sheldon
1551,oh great see you at seven,Sheldon
1552,she’s younger and far more attractive than he is they’re copying you two,Sheldon
1553,bert rebecca i’d like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier,Sheldon
1554,see it was fine i didn’t need a timeout,Sheldon
1555,you made me sit on the stairs and think about what i did,Sheldon
1556,what’d you do delete your photo,Sheldon
1557,fine,Sheldon
1558,aw man,Sheldon
1559,i’d say she’s copying you again but i’m getting tired of sitting in the hall,Sheldon
1560,your first date did you even measure her walls,Sheldon
1561,who’s ready to laugh,Sheldon
1562,okay so feynman einstein and schrodinger walk into a bar feynman says it appears,Sheldon
1563,that’s a good one okay now leonard you tell a joke,Sheldon
1564,comments from our behind the flags retrospective get this people are calling it the longest one yet,Sheldon
1565,he’s not wrong it was your crackpot idea that he deserves love,Sheldon
1566,you and leonard don’t have anything in common maybe you should break up,Sheldon
1567,actually our friendship group is at capacity but if anybody drops out you’re at the top of the list unless it’s raj in which case we’ll probably get a person of colour,Sheldon
1568,so he’s using his money to attract a mate is that any different than me using my intelligence to attract amy or leonard using his power of grovelling to get penny,Sheldon
1569,oh so many things her mind her kindness and especially her body,Sheldon
1570,hello i’m dr sheldon cooper,Sheldon
1571,based on the glowing reception of our recent behind the flags retrospective we thought you might like to see how it all came together,Sheldon
1572,ooh we already have our first call,Sheldon
1573,everything is stupid and i want to go home,Sheldon
1574,hey it’s not even called the genius grant it’s the macarthur fellowship just like it’s not frankenstein it’s frankenstein’s monster which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there and if anyone’s a genius it’s me for the way i brought that full circle,Sheldon
1575,oh good maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under,Sheldon
1576,i know how to behave,Sheldon

1584,yeh why eh why oh that’s why,Sheldon
1585,i hope you’re happy making me read this bert’s work is remarkable and i’m more upset than ever this is worse than when i had to admit that cedric the entertainer’s actually entertaining,Sheldon
1586,yeah well i am angry and you telling me not to be angry makes me angry and do you know how hearing myself say the word angry over and over makes me feel,Sheldon
1587,that’s a good idea i guess everyone’s having them now,Sheldon
1588,fine you can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons,Sheldon
1589,i admire you leonard,Sheldon
1590,you’re happy with who you are you don’t get jealous of other people instead of being weighed down by ambition you just float along like a dead body in a river,Sheldon
1591,how did you deal with it,Sheldon
1592,i can’t believe i was surpassed by a geologist i mean rocks he studies rocks if rock is so great how come paper beats it leonard i’m having a primal urge to throw this rock,Sheldon

1594,ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow…,Sheldon
1595,i tried to let go of anger and threw a rock into my foot,Sheldon
1596,yeah but you’ve got all those things and no one’s lining up to be you,Sheldon
1597,uh do you really think calling me names is helpful,Sheldon
1598,maybe you’re right,Sheldon
1599,thank you penny you know i just need to keep reminding myself that bert’s success is not my failure,Sheldon
1600,and that men of his large stature are more susceptible to a wide array of lifethreatening diseases,Sheldon
1601,top of the afternoon gentlemen,Sheldon
1602,well it’s a new day i have a new outlook you know i realized i don’t need to worry about other people i just need to think more about myself,Sheldon

1643,look look here i am standing next to the incubator uh here is a microscopic view of the cells,Sheldon
1644,aw yeah this little guy can already recognize electronically transmitted images faster than any other sample in amy’s lab,Sheldon
1645,yeah i have to say it is nice to share this experience with someone who’s on the same journey although right now ours is testing off the charts while yours is floating around in its own waste,Sheldon
1646,well i didn’t make you waddle up four flights of stairs for the heck of it,Sheldon
1647,yeah but ours can recognize a specific data stream among background noise,Sheldon
1648,ours doesn’t need an immune system because it lives in a stateoftheart german incubator,Sheldon
1649,okay fine let’s just agree that both creations are special in their own way and it is foolish to try and compare them although we didn’t need to have sex with howard for ours so we win,Sheldon
1650,would you look at that the image we gave it was white noise and it still managed to reconstruct it,Sheldon
1651,yeah we need to stop for magnets on the way home this is going right on the fridge,Sheldon
1652,oh i am and you realize what the next step is,Sheldon
1653,uh no we lock that door lower our underpants a little and make a baby,Sheldon
1654,clearly the combination of our dna is exceptional our child could be the next step in the evolution of mankind we’ll be able to get into any preschool we want,Sheldon
1655,oh yes you are i track your cycle for the next hours you’re as fertile as a manurecovered wheat field,Sheldon
1656,i don’t understand i thought you’d be thrilled to procreate with me,Sheldon

1666,you guys are aroused right,Sheldon
1667,hello,Sheldon

1669,i have a plan to work on both projects simultaneously and for your information the summer conference on algebraic topology at caltech is nerd prom,Sheldon
1670,well i’m not needed at both places at the same time and i can also free up extra hours with simple tricks such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point,Sheldon
1671,soon see i could’ve said in the near future but i didn’t say in the near future because in the near future is three more words than soon in one the two near three future four see in the near future is four soon is just one four is more than one saving time already,Sheldon

1679,brb that’s short for be right back i’m saving so much time,Sheldon

1730,okay thanks just throw it out speaking of occupants i’m given to understand raj will be moving into my old room,Sheldon
1731,what about his dog,Sheldon
1732,i suppose that’s acceptable,Sheldon
1733,if real dogs gave me buttons i’d like them too well i think it’s very nice that you’re helping out our friend,Sheldon
1734,and what is that supposed to mean,Sheldon
1735,if you’re implying that i’d have some problem with him moving into my room you’re wrong raj is in a difficult financial situation and i’m glad that he’s making changes to improve it,Sheldon
1736,i mean it’s unfair people just assume i’m going to be upset by raj moving into my old room,Sheldon
1737,oh i’m outraged,Sheldon
1738,well that’s been my room since before i met leonard and now someone else is going to be living in it and that someone else is not me and you know how i feel about people who aren’t me,Sheldon
1739,wrong we were standing outside my room in the hallway,Sheldon
1740,i realize it’s irrational but with raj moving in there i’m feeling a bit replaced,Sheldon
1741,yes probably but until we know for sure how can i feel better,Sheldon
1742,all set,Sheldon
1743,a housewarming gift for raj,Sheldon
1744,it’s nothing like that i just i thought about raj’s situation and i had a change of heart you know and regarding your gift you said surprise me and boy did i hello,Sheldon
1745,uh wait before we eat i have a little welcome to the building gift for raj,Sheldon
1746,well i had some of my best ideas in that room and i’m sure you will too,Sheldon
1747,well i know this is a difficult time for you you’re losing your apartment you’re in debt and you just you must be humiliated,Sheldon
1748,oh good grief she is such a stickler for citing sources those were amy’s words,Sheldon
1749,i know i know good grief was originally said by charlie brown geez,Sheldon
1750,can you believe this guy,Sheldon
1751,i thought that was gonna break the other way,Sheldon
1752,fine you took my room you turned my friends against me i hope you’re happy,Sheldon
1753,how come he can say it and i can’t,Sheldon
1754,honestly i’ve been better do you have time leonard says you’re very busy these days,Sheldon
1755,well our friend raj moved into my old room and it’s brought up a lot of negative feelings for me,Sheldon
1756,beverley you know i hold you in high esteem can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer and get to the part where you tell me the answer,Sheldon
1757,i have,Sheldon
1758,i hadn’t thought about that,Sheldon
1759,i had no idea all our relationships were such a disaster boy you’re good,Sheldon
1760,hey raj i owe you an apology look could you please put your dog on a leash,Sheldon
1761,well then at least hold her still so i can pretend she’s stuffed raj i let my emotions get the best of me and i unfairly took it out on you,Sheldon
1762,no i can’t take all the credit i spoke with leonard’s mother and she made me feel better,Sheldon
1763,beverly pointed out that i’m experiencing insecurities in my relationship with amy in the same way that leonard and penny are in their relationship,Sheldon
1764,yes you’re fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems it used to be me now it’s raj and his attack tribble anyway i’m sorry for everything oh and fyi if you cry while they’re fighting they’ll take you to mcdonald’s,Sheldon
1765,i can’t sleep,Sheldon
1766,beverley believes i unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch,Sheldon
1767,yes i don’t care for unconscious thoughts my brain and i are best friends it should tell me everything,Sheldon
1768,what if she’s correct doesn’t that say something troubling about us,Sheldon
1769,that is true did you know i figured out in which order i would eat all my friends in the event of an apocalypse,Sheldon
1770,penny would be the entree then leonard’s basically a cheese course and because i love you you’re dessert,Sheldon
1771,amy quick lock the door,Sheldon
1772,you know what i’m proud of us yeah with penny and leonard taking in raj and stuart living with howard and bernadette we’re the only couple of our social group who doesn’t need to fill the holes in their relationship with a third party,Sheldon
1773,how are you settling in,Sheldon
1774,now i’ve learned some fun facts about new jersey to help you make small talk would you like to know the state bird or the murder rate they’re both shocking,Sheldon
1775,well i’m a lot less likely to see an eastern goldfinch or be murdered i’ll tell you that,Sheldon
1776,i miss you too,Sheldon
1777,i’m sorry you had to go through that,Sheldon
1778,you know you just split an infinitive,Sheldon
1779,i am it is naughty to put an adverb between the word to and the verb stem,Sheldon
1780,i’m going to admonish you,Sheldon
1781,that’s the only kind of admonishing i do,Sheldon
1782,gentlemen you may remember dr nowitzki she’s back at caltech for her postdoc,Sheldon
1783,oh thanks dr nowitzki’s going to tell me about the work she did at cern and she brought me this dutyfree toblerone,Sheldon
1784,let’s sit somewhere else,Sheldon
1785,so tell me about your scalar dark energy experiment,Sheldon
1786,oh you must be one of those dessert before dinner people,Sheldon
1787,and get this i saw an articulating ladder with dualleg leveling which delivers stability and adaptability to uneven terrain,Sheldon
1788,yeah raj made the funniest joke he said which is the best ladder to use to hang myself,Sheldon
1789,oh not at all i’ve had outings with leonard and raj in the evening and oh i had lunch,Sheldon
1790,oh dr nowitzki is a woman,Sheldon
1791,many years ago back when she was a grad student she’s always been a huge fan of my work and now she’s doing research at caltech,Sheldon
1792,yes i think you’d like her she’s extremely intelligent just like you unlike you she’s tall blonde and used to be an olympic swimmer,Sheldon
1793,hey everybody this is my friend dr nowitzki,Sheldon
1794,we just went swimming,Sheldon
1795,i was scared but i told myself it’s just a big bathtub then i got scared again ’cause there are all these strangers in my bathtub,Sheldon
1796,well i was hiding from a bee but it still counts,Sheldon
1797,yes we skyped this morning and i’m sure i’ll check in with her before i go to sleep,Sheldon
1798,that is true she keeps asking how long amy’s going to be gone,Sheldon
1799,leonard your wife is sitting right here what are you doing,Sheldon
1800,she was part of the american team at cern,Sheldon
1801,do you know i’ve corresponded with peter higgs would you like to see some of his letters,Sheldon
1802,i’ll get them,Sheldon
1803,oh fun like a play date,Sheldon
1804,here you go,Sheldon
1805,hmm oh no no no they’re from many famous people see oh like this one this is from patrick stewart it says if i come to his house again i get to meet his dogs oh excuse me,Sheldon
1806,oh hello amy,Sheldon
1807,i miss you too hey this is good timing remember that dr nowitzki i told you about she’s right here,Sheldon
1808,what is leonard doing calling you at this hour,Sheldon
1809,i must tell you that seems a little inappropriate don’t you agree,Sheldon
1810,see we both think so,Sheldon
1811,hey i hate to break up the party but amy says i’m tired and have to go to bed,Sheldon
1812,of course,Sheldon
1813,that was fun it was like mario kart,Sheldon
1814,bye,Sheldon
1815,what is this about leonard and amy i don’t like it either,Sheldon
1816,that doesn’t make any sense she knows i have a girlfriend,Sheldon
1817,that may be true but dr nowitzki’s just a friend in fact i wouldn’t have even noticed she’s a woman if she hadn’t worn that bathing suit that highlighted her bosom,Sheldon
1818,i already do,Sheldon
1819,because there’s only one of me i’m more valuable,Sheldon
1820,although amy’s already taken me out of my package and played with me,Sheldon
1821,penny look i appreciate your concern but i don’t think that’s what’s happening,Sheldon
1822,i think dr nowitzki is a friendly colleague i think you and leonard need to see a marriage counsellor and i need to update my résumé to include swimming as a special skill,Sheldon
1823,uh breakfast yes lunch no i did have a cough drop but that really rides the line between sucking and eating,Sheldon
1824,how thoughtful thank you,Sheldon
1825,and i with you question are you seeking a romantic relationship with me,Sheldon
1826,well that would raise a number of problems we’re colleagues i’m currently in a relation… excuse me a moment,Sheldon
1827,knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy knock knock knock amy will you marry me,Sheldon
1828,things have been going really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope,Sheldon
1829,oh the project is classified i can’t tell you oh i suppose i could redact the classified parts all right um i came up with an elegant solution to the honks horn i used the honks horn and then i honks horn and that did it car passes honking horn wow i wonder what they’re redacting,Sheldon
1830,oh very well what have you been working on and feel free to honk during the boring parts,Sheldon
1831,so you’re attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain,Sheldon
1832,well what do you know here i was waiting to be bored with biology and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy which unlike my body is an okay place to tickle,Sheldon
1833,gentlemen the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon,Sheldon
1834,yeah i picked it up without thinking about it which raises a neuroscientific question when did i decide to pick it up,Sheldon
1835,amy is studying the time lag between intent and awareness and i realized that applies to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics now i recognize there will be a time lag between me saying that and you googling what it means so i’ll wait,Sheldon
1836,well don’t get me wrong neurobiology’s nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff but you know when it connects to physics gas up the ford martha we’re going for a drive,Sheldon
1837,i was thinking about your experiment on the neuroscience of decision making and i realized if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness in the copenhagen interpretation,Sheldon
1838,it could be the most inspired combination since i mixed red icee into my blue icee it was like drinking two sevenths of the rainbow,Sheldon
1839,yeah and this one won’t stain my teeth purple,Sheldon
1840,that is a valid point perhaps we should establish some ground rules,Sheldon
1841,all right let’s start right now uh rule number one no using sexuality to get your way,Sheldon
1842,is it,Sheldon
1843,i believe i’ve made some progress on our ground rules,Sheldon
1844,okay uh number one in matters of physics i have the final say in matters of neuroscience you have the final say unless i disagree oh here number two when we publish,Sheldon
1845,oh of course i’ll get that back like all my underwear that notebook says property of sheldon cooper,Sheldon
1846,i’d write that down but i can’t now can i,Sheldon
1847,thank you you are a good citizen told you go ahead throw my underwear out the window same thing’s gonna happen,Sheldon
1848,fire away,Sheldon
1849,that’s smart because sheldon amy,Sheldon
1850,aw someone drew a penis in it,Sheldon
1851,i’m sorry go ahead,Sheldon
1852,ooh that sounds fun now we’re talking about real treats right not bible verses like my mother used to give me,Sheldon
1853,biology and physics coming together this is like the peanut butter cup of the mind oh i know what i want my treat to be,Sheldon
1854,yes this is remarkable,Sheldon
1855,by the way your name can go first,Sheldon
1856,yeah the math is so inelegant i’m not even sure it makes sense,Sheldon
1857,can you stop breathing so loud i can hear your nose whistling,Sheldon
1858,all right either blow your nose or teach it to play camptown races,Sheldon
1859,no i can still hear it oh wait that’s me never mind it’s fine,Sheldon
1860,hold on i see what’s wrong here we did the propagation only to the occipital lobe not to the prefrontal cortex,Sheldon
1861,oh that is much better yeah boy if good ideas came out of your brain the way mucus comes out of your nose we’d be in good shape,Sheldon
1862,just because i am easily bothered by light heat sound smell and the way birds look at me does not mean i’m sensitive,Sheldon
1863,that is a daring and insightful solution,Sheldon
1864,what if the fighting is the reason we’re making progress,Sheldon
1865,well if that’s the case then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture,Sheldon
1866,it seems we have a choice to make abandon all ground rules in the name of science or give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship,Sheldon
1867,science it is,Sheldon
1868,name calling that is perfect now when i get to this equation here really let me have it you know if it helps i’m not the sharpest dresser,Sheldon
1869,can you read them back,Sheldon
1870,excellent excellent and on a related point you’re going down punk,Sheldon
1871,i love that one,Sheldon
1872,yeah that list is strong like your mother’s urge to be promiscuous with sailors,Sheldon
1873,hi,Penny
1874,oh let me guess you guys are drafting your fantasy accounting firms,Penny
1875,well he has a job how bad can it be,Penny

1884,oh you really sleep on the sidewalk huh,Penny
1885,well you and i would get our own room right,Penny

1887,you know it’s no big deal i can put up with anything for three days,Penny
1888,are you kidding me,Penny
1889,i can’t it’ll break his heart you know he’s always making an effort to do things with me he doesn’t enjoy like going outside,Penny
1890,you know maybe it won’t be that bad leonard says it’s really mainstream now comic books aren’t just for sad nerds any more i mean it is still a key part of their demographic,Penny
1891,is there any scenario where we’re not in full body paint,Penny
1892,hey um are you sure the guys are okay with me coming,Penny

2518,i don’t know we shouldn’t worry her if it’s nothing,Penny
2519,yeah do you think living with amy has somehow stirred up sheldon’s sexual appetite,Penny

2604,you know what i’m not gonna go either i’m a father now i’d rather spend time with my family,Howard
2605,i’m gonna go check on dinner,Howard
2606,it’s pretty late you think i’ve got time to run some more simulations on the cooling system,Howard
2607,what,Howard
2608,hey hey hey you’re not going anywhere,Howard
2609,well wake up we’re gonna put in a lot of late nights,Howard
2610,well i don’t know midnight one,Howard
2611,if you’re tired have some coffee,Howard
2612,i am having coffee,Howard
2613,sorry i have to work all weekend,Howard
2614,thanks again for breakfast,Howard
2615,why is it taking him so long to get a drink out of a vending machine,Howard
2616,you wanted him awake,Howard
2617,maybe we should break for lunch what time is it,Howard
2618,why don’t you just go home,Howard
2619,you can’t develop a problem that fast,Howard
2620,well this probably won’t work but has anyone ever tried to just haul off and whup the crazy out of him,Howard
2621,no worries,Howard
2622,that was painful to watch,Howard
2623,no,Howard
2624,when the baby gets here you gotta teach me that,Howard
2625,we’ve hit a bit of a snag we’re already behind schedule,Howard
2626,we we’re thinking two years,Howard
2627,that’s it you’re okay with that,Howard
2628,yes thank you so much,Howard
2629,wanna see a movie,Howard
2630,all right we got a problem,Howard
2631,the air force contacted me about our quantum gyroscope they want to have a meeting,Howard
2632,and if that happens we’ll never be able to sell it commercially,Howard
2633,i was counting on that money i need to make as much as my wife so i don’t have to try so hard in bed,Howard
2634,oh yeah how do you think i stay this thin,Howard
2635,sheldon we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years,Howard
2636,you know maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer,Howard
2637,why because i’m jewish that’s like me saying hey you’re indian doesn’t your cousin work in a call centre,Howard
2638,and my cousin’s a lawyer,Howard
2639,give me a second to call my cousin,Howard
2640,first of all he’s in boca raton which is better than fort lauderdale but more importantly he lasted two days on jeopardy so he’s clearly a smart guy,Howard
2641,hey marty thanks for talking to us,Howard
2642,well i married a little catholic girl so we’re even anyway this is leonard and sheldon the three of us came up with the guidance system,Howard
2643,and this is my friend raj,Howard
2644,anyway like i said in the email this meeting’s on thursday do you have any advice for us,Howard
2645,marty let me call you back,Howard
2646,no,Howard
2647,hello,Howard
2648,it’s a group effort but i guess if we had to pick a main brain it would be me,Howard
2649,really you’re a physicist,Howard
2650,oh well hey me too,Howard
2651,well thanks but you should know we’re a little concerned about this being used in weapons,Howard
2652,i’m not even sure that’s possible,Howard
2653,four months,Howard
2654,well maybe i don’t know we’ll have to work hours a day seven days a week,Howard
2655,i love your french toast,Howard
2656,we didn’t sheldon did,Howard
2657,no but mostly there was an awkward pause and i broke it by saying okay,Howard
2658,would you stop we’re just gonna be on the other side of campus,Howard
2659,you are a deeply silly man,Howard
2660,maybe that’s because it’s classified,Howard
2661,i guess this is it,Howard
2662,let’s find out,Howard
2663,oh oh oh oh guys hold me upside down,Howard
2664,go come on raj,Howard
2665,we’re betting to see if koothrappali can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin,Howard
2666,yeah we’re seeing if raj can hold his breath longer than it,Howard
2667,yes he is,Howard
2668,ha you’re interested you’re out ten bucks,Howard
2669,come on raj it’s like your favourite movie you’re just waiting to exhale yeah i knew you could do it,Howard
2670,and the car ride puts her to sleep,Howard
2671,oh no now we have two,Howard
2672,maybe your dad’s right,Howard
2673,you don’t need your dad’s money you can get by on your salary,Howard
2674,well how much do you spend on food,Howard
2675,what what are you doing i i i schlepped the baby over i brought imported beer why don’t you like me,Howard
2676,we are that’s why i’m sad my best friend’s gonna be homeless,Howard
2677,wait why are we talking about our place when sheldon’s old room is sitting there perfectly empty,Howard
2678,oh how’s the dog gonna go to the bathroom,Howard
2679,that’s understandable,Howard
2680,i thought things were going well what happened,Howard
2681,sometimes people say things they don’t mean,Howard
2682,because that’s not what people do,Howard
2683,you if it’s at mit i can make some calls maybe we can get sheldon a prototype,Howard
2684,sheldon i just heard from the guys at mit about that emotion reader they’re sending a prototype for you to beta test,Howard
2685,well you don’t need a machine for that just send a survey card to all your exgirlfriends and tell them if they fill it out they might win a prize,Howard
2686,yeah i was joking,Howard
2687,this thing’s pretty cool it interprets emotions using a wireless signal to analyse subtle changes in breathing and heart rate,Howard
2688,the display is synced to your phone give it a try,Howard
2689,okay remember it can only detect happy sad angry and excited not other things you’re feeling like what have i done with my life,Howard
2690,try another one,Howard
2691,oh god you went through with that what is wrong with you,Howard
2692,you’re so stupid,Howard
2693,no he doesn’t think it’s stupid,Howard
2694,hey you went out with him i didn’t,Howard
2695,like this one,Howard
2696,schmuck got it,Howard
2697,not a chance so you were telling us how raj was terrible in bed,Howard
2698,i thought you were great but oh my god you were so dominated by your parents,Howard
2699,sorry is that gary with one r or two,Howard
2700,oh wow don’t let him get away,Howard
2701,uh basically she traded you for bruce wayne,Howard
2702,wait hang on i just want to point out to everyone here this is a man who is going to great lengths to better himself even at the risk of being humiliated and i for one think that’s very brave,Howard
2703,well like you gals i had to suffer through him to find bernadette,Howard
2704,thanks ladies this was fun let’s not wait so long for another bizarre awkward night,Howard
2705,don’t beat yourself up that’s what i’m here for,Howard
2706,yeah the field was just here the field said no,Howard
2707,okay i’ll tell you what i’ll make you a deal years from now if you’re still single and things don’t work out with me and bernadette you and i can give it a go,Howard
2708,too late stuart called dibs,Howard
2709,i don’t know what difference does it make,Howard
2710,those do look fun,Howard
2711,if you didn’t want me to eat it why’d you put it out,Howard
2712,i’m not gonna get fat,Howard
2713,fine look i’ll exercise right now one two these are crunches by the way,Howard
2714,okay how about if i eat like this,Howard
2715,hey is that any way to talk to your future husband,Howard
2716,please when you see the ring i pick out you’re gonna melt,Howard
2717,okay i’m zeroing out the electroosmotic flow rate in the microfluidic channel,Howard
2718,well my wife is fourfootten and sexually satisfied so clearly i know my way around tiny things,Howard
2719,those are just the things i say out loud,Howard
2720,what’s wrong,Howard
2721,yeah it doesn’t need to be smaller,Howard
2722,sheldon we don’t need to make this smaller and your work is done go home,Howard
2723,i know that’s why i keep refilling his water when he’s not looking,Howard
2724,i don’t care if we’re in a drought it’s worth it,Howard
2725,we can just lock the door you don’t have to kill him,Howard
2726,it’s so peaceful without him here can i ask you how much that cost,Howard
2727,great we found a cooling solution that allowed us to get the size of the prototype down to the target specs,Howard
2728,but we’ve already met the agreed upon specs going smaller would require weeks’ worth of new computations,Howard
2729,okay but that’s just a theory it’s not even a complete thought,Howard
2730,the kid with the two shirts screwed us again,Howard
2731,i can’t believe we have to ask sheldon to come back and help us,Howard
2732,i don’t know but if he yells it’s alive we run,Howard
2733,how’d you even get that up the stairs,Howard
2734,open a window it’s about to get smug in here,Howard
2735,he’s worried about looking foolish that’s a heapin’ helping of irony right there,Howard
2736,all right hmm feel free to jump in hmm is all i got,Howard
2737,maybe we can find another theoretical physicist to help us,Howard
2738,hey i came up with that and hmm you haven’t pitched anything,Howard
2739,you really figured it out,Howard
2740,oh you’re a genius,Howard
2741,that’s right we figured it out all by ourselves wasn’t even that hard,Howard
2742,it’s a manifold,Howard
2743,told ya can you fix it for us,Howard
2744,but if you really want to learn the mechanical side i can teach you anything you want to know,Howard
2745,and with all these new skills you’d be able to fix any model train you’d be the king of the train store,Howard
2746,that’s a turbo,Howard
2747,maybe to you you didn’t get a traffic ticket,Howard
2748,hey if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic then yeah okay,Howard
2749,i have performance anxiety you of all people should know that,Howard
2750,raj who’s at the door,Howard
2751,that’s great now they know where i live,Howard

2756,why wouldn’t that colonel say what the meeting’s about it has to be bad news,Howard
2757,that’s really stupid advice,Howard
2758,calm down try not to think about it,Howard
2759,why do i bother talking to you,Howard
2760,i don’t know they take the invention away and i get nothing,Howard
2761,what’s the point of that story,Howard
2762,at least she’s yelling at someone else for a change,Howard
2763,as soon as i get home we’re hoping to make it before dark,Howard
2764,well she wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes,Howard
2765,well he wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes,Howard
2766,honey how ya feeling sound of bernadette vomiting violently the book says at this stage of the pregnancy morning sickness should be going away more vomiting so that’s good news right,Howard
2767,there she is who’s ready for a hot threehour car ride to the desert,Howard
2768,i’m sorry we don’t have to go,Howard
2769,how ’bout we stay here we don’t even have to tell anyone it’ll be like a secret vacation at home,Howard

2780,well the answer is both more and less disturbing than you think,Howard
2781,stuart he heard me talking about us going away i guess he decided to invite himself over,Howard
2782,maybe how ’bout hey you look like a boiled chicken breast,Howard
2783,nah that’s not gonna hurt his feelings,Howard
2784,maybe this is why people get fish tanks who just turned the porch lights on,Howard
2785,well clearly i lied,Howard
2786,he’s in our hot tub drinking our wine,Howard
2787,those jets are for my secret spot not his,Howard

3930,great what’d you have in mind,Amy
3931,well how about we start a little smaller like moving the furniture around,Amy
3932,look we can’t just throw away penny’s stuff but we can ask if she wants any of it back,Amy

3934,it may have appreciated in value the artist killed himself shortly after painting that,Amy
3935,i can’t wait to see the look on her face when i give it to her again,Amy

3953,oh my this is a big step,Amy
3954,what do you think,Amy
3955,sheldon i understand your apprehension but let me appeal to the scientist in you given the fiveweek end date isn’t it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility,Amy
3956,so is that a yes,Amy
3957,sheldon what do you think,Amy
3958,seriously,Amy
3959,oh this is so exciting,Amy
3960,you’ve been roommates with sheldon forever do you have any advice,Amy
3961,i don’t know i didn’t count,Amy
3962,that’s me listen you and i are gonna be sharing a bed you know this is uncharted territory for both of us how are you feeling about that,Amy
3963,well if you’re nervous about the sleeping arrangements maybe we should talk about it,Amy
3964,well i imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations,Amy
3965,look i know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone so why don’t we take being physical off the table and maybe later on once we’re more settled in we can revisit it,Amy
3966,i’ve never lived with someone either this is a lot for me too,Amy
3967,good call seeing your teen titans underwear really got my motor running,Amy
3968,thank you,Amy
3969,shall we,Amy
3970,come on sheldon,Amy
3971,well that’s it for the next five weeks we are officially living together,Amy
3972,doesn’t matter to me your choice,Amy
3973,well sheldon i really appreciate that but these things mean more to you than they do to me so whatever you want,Amy
3974,well i’m not refusing i’m just trying to be considerate,Amy
3975,sheldon will you please just pick a side,Amy
3976,great that’s your side,Amy
3977,okay i’ll take that side,Amy
3978,rising rapidly,Amy
3979,okay what if we do this,Amy
3980,great,Amy
3981,ugh what is that entering why did you switch sides,Amy
3982,comfy,Amy
3983,sheldon i know we took coitus off the table but i was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy such as snuggling,Amy
3984,sheldon i’ve made more than enough accommodations for you we’re both grown adults we’ve been far more intimate than this if you don’t want to snuggle fine but we’re not building a pillow wall,Amy
3985,oh oh oh,Amy
3986,hang on,Amy
3987,i’m so sore i don’t think i slept two minutes last night,Amy
3988,it’s not what you think,Amy
3989,i don’t know if i can make it through five weeks living with him,Amy
3990,miserable and exhausted,Amy
3991,well i didn’t and it’s your fault,Amy
3992,sheldon maybe living together is a bad idea,Amy
3993,the kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night,Amy
3994,i’m sorry are you questioning my integrity as a scientist,Amy
3995,what would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway i mean you wouldn’t know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time and you don’t even get that joke ’cause you don’t even work with confounding variables,Amy
3996,oh you heard me your experimental bona fides are laughable,Amy
3997,can’t make fun of something that’s a null set,Amy
3998,well for science maybe i will,Amy
3999,fine,Amy
4000,good,Amy
4001,do you want to go to our place and make out,Amy
4002,hi,Amy
4003,it was not a great trip,Amy
4004,i rented one of those carts pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest,Amy
4005,so while we’re at your mother’s house it might be a good time to tell her that we’re living together,Amy
4006,maybe there won’t be one,Amy
4007,well she likes me you know there’s a chance she might be okay with it,Amy
4008,thank you for cooking it looks delicious,Amy
4009,well uh howard and bernadette had their baby,Amy
4010,they haven’t said anyway we uh we also have some exciting news to share,Amy
4011,sheldon don’t overreact,Amy
4012,blah blah blah blah blah,Amy
4013,i’ll take over from here,Amy
4014,he’s been in there a long time should i go talk to him,Amy
4015,are you going to,Amy
4016,sheldon what what are you doing,Amy
4017,we’re ignoring the fins okay,Amy
4018,i don’t think that’s what she’s saying,Amy
4019,that’s exactly what she was saying,Amy
4020,well after that sheldon and i got out of the house for a while,Amy
4021,you know i’m sorry your mother made you feel bad but you know at the end of the day she was wrong because you’re not alone,Amy
4022,what about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet,Amy
4023,well let’s try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip,Amy
4024,she was gonna find out eventually,Amy
4025,sheldon i knew your mother was fine with us living together because i already told her we were,Amy
4026,this was a potential issue so i got out ahead of it and i managed the situation for you,Amy
4027,that’s right,Amy
4028,not your whole life i mean science you got that organizing your sock drawer you’re the king but understanding how other people are feeling that’s a weak spot for you,Amy
4029,have you how am i feeling right now,Amy
4030,you and i are in a relationship i help you with your shortcomings and you help me with mine,Amy
4031,delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all,Amy
4032,do you need help,Amy
4033,like the pirate who helps the other pirates connect to the internet,Amy
4034,really you’re never gonna touch their baby,Amy
4035,sheldon,Amy
4036,that was fun thank you,Amy
4037,you know with us living together maybe we could think about having people over,Amy

4041,well that’s so nice who’s coming,Amy

4062,so in the spirit of cohabitation the theme of today’s episode is flags of two regions coming together as one such as the flag of st kitts and nevis,Amy
4063,did you know that the flag was designed by a student named edrice lewis…,Amy
4064,it’s almost dinner time you in the mood for anything,Amy

4069,good stuff so uh what about dinner,Amy

4071,um it was a drywall problem,Amy
4072,well the drywall got wet and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall gets wet it’s really more…,Amy
4073,or damp wall just as bad,Amy
4074,well they went to get some but the woman at the wall store said it was going on sale and they should wait because the savings…,Amy
4075,i was done at wet wall but you wouldn’t let it go,Amy

4103,hi,Amy
4104,what are you doing,Amy
4105,i understand i’ll leave you be,Amy
4106,of course jean buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralysed by indecision and would starve to death,Amy
4107,well i wouldn’t want you to starve to death so here’s an eggplant,Amy
4108,you know some people believe that buridan was plagiarizing aristotle,Amy
4109,although in aristotle’s example he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink,Amy
4110,are you suggesting alghazali was aristotelian ‘cause if anything he was antiaristotelian,Amy
4111,penny is it weird that we’re having girls’ night here but you don’t live here any more so it’s basically my girls’ night,Amy
4112,but now you’re thinking about it and it bothers you i get that,Amy

4128,sheldon why don’t we give them some privacy,Amy
4129,uhhuh,Amy

4135,to denial,Amy
4136,hey,Amy
4137,what smells so good,Amy
4138,is this part of your superaging,Amy
4139,well clearly mental tasks are not enough maybe you need to challenge your motor skills,Amy
4140,how did you get from croissants to a unicycle,Amy

4142,have you tried letting go of the rope,Amy
4143,all right well have fun,Amy

4147,you said juggling was dumb too,Amy
4148,sheldon is it possible that when things get really difficult you just give up,Amy
4149,well if you honestly…,Amy
4150,his mother warned me everybody warned me actually he warned me,Amy
4151,i made you tea,Amy
4152,i’m sorry i called you a quitter,Amy
4153,what are you reading,Amy
4154,so,Amy
4155,that’s ridiculous you’re a brilliant man the best years of your life are still ahead of you,Amy
4156,well if you’re really worried about your career maybe you should consider spending a little less time with video games and comic books,Amy
4157,okay fine let’s say you never win a nobel prize let’s say you spend your life doing solid scientific research surrounded by friends and loved ones who appreciate you not for what you’ve accomplished but for who you are as a man wouldn’t that be a life welllived,Amy
4158,so many warnings,Amy
4159,you know it’s nice of you to acknowledge us but this is your accomplishment,Amy
4160,where are you moving,Amy
4161,well good for you i actually have a little news myself,Amy
4162,i was uh asked to be a visiting researcher at princeton,Amy
4163,thanks but the thing is i’ll be gone for a few months and i don’t know how sheldon’s gonna feel about that,Amy
4164,you really believe that,Amy

4176,sheldon you’re you’re being silly,Amy
4177,you know what you need to do is put this air force project behind you and just dive into something new,Amy
4178,oh i don’t know i mean let’s say we succeed in proving that our consciousness creates reality i mean what will we have really accomplished you know a loaf of bread’s still three bucks,Amy
4179,that is true i have said that,Amy
4180,i was offered a summer research fellowship at princeton,Amy
4181,yeah that’s the one,Amy
4182,well i haven’t accepted it yet i wanted to talk to you first,Amy
4183,so are you,Amy
4184,are are you sure,Amy

4186,guys,Amy
4187,i don’t know sheldon’s so vulnerable right now,Amy
4188,of course i get to be part of the first team to use radon markers to map the structures that…,Amy
4189,i know but what if sheldon…,Amy
4190,hey you don’t know what goes on behind closed doors,Amy
4191,all right so you know,Amy
4192,hey you going somewhere,Amy

4196,i am,Amy
4197,i wasn’t thinking that,Amy
4198,that’s a risk i’m willing to take,Amy
4199,what if we don’t fold our clothes at all,Amy
4200,my goodness that form of stimulation is highly efficient,Amy
4201,okay the car is waiting do you want to walk me downstairs,Amy
4202,is it,Amy
4203,do you think it’s possible you might enjoy being on your own for a little while,Amy

4216,almost many of them on purpose,Amy
4217,and don’t get discouraged if the phone lines are jammed just keep trying long pause oh thank god welcome to fun with flags,Amy
4218,and what does that have to do with flags,Amy
4219,ooh ooh all right we have our next caller,Amy

4228,oh you know good for you,Amy
4229,you know you need to start raising your hand before you speak yes starting now,Amy
4230,relax we’re the same blood type he knew he could harvest an organ,Amy
4231,and i’m dr amy farrah fowler,Amy
4232,so welcome to tonight’s episode,Amy
4233,oh hello you’re on fun with flags,Amy
4234,bert is studying the way microbes in rocks can survive in extreme environmental conditions,Amy
4235,you know sheldon maybe if you take the time to actually read bert’s research you’d be less bitter about him winning,Amy
4236,honestly i just want you to be quiet but i’m all out of taffy,Amy
4237,sounds like the night we had coitus,Amy
4238,sheldon it’s foolish to be angry that bert’s work has merit,Amy
4239,what happened,Amy
4240,you know it’s one thing to be envious but now you’re injuring yourself it has to stop,Amy
4241,you know sheldon instead of fixating on what bert has you should appreciate all of the good things in your life you’ve got love you’re in good health you’ve got a roof over your head,Amy
4242,anybody else want to try i’m gonna go make some more tea and question my life choices,Amy
4243,really,Amy
4244,what’s up,Amy
4245,yep,Amy
4246,i can’t believe you headbutted a water fountain,Amy
4247,what about me and sheldon,Amy
4248,ever since i met penny i’ve been envious of her looks,Amy
4249,that’s why i was so happy when you cut your hair off,Amy
4250,you know what i mean you were still hot but more like a why’d that hot girl cut off all her hair hot,Amy
4251,how can you feel bad if stephen hawking says you’re brilliant,Amy
4252,way ahead of you,Amy
4253,it’s just a tiny skin sample you saw me do it to myself,Amy
4254,a two,Amy
4255,sheldon if i’m gonna synthesize a neural network from our skin cells i need to harvest them now i’ve done this dozens of times but if you’re too scared you don’t have to,Amy
4256,thank you,Amy
4257,just think how happy you’ll be in a few weeks when i’ve converted our skin cells into functional brain cells,Amy
4258,okay three two and we’re done,Amy
4259,it didn’t hurt did it,Amy
4260,okay fine one,Amy
4261,if you’d give me a minute i’ll tell you,Amy
4262,those are your eyelashes move well sheldon i see astrocytes our combined skin cells are now a primitive neural network,Amy
4263,these cells come from both of us,Amy
4264,no reason we can’t start right now,Amy
4265,sheldon this is a rudimentary collection of neurons i mean it’s remarkable but it’s still limited in what it can do,Amy
4266,you know most people don’t realize this technique has actually been around for a few years,Amy
4267,well i turned this one into a functioning boyfriend so sky’s the limit,Amy
4268,so enough about us how are things going with you,Amy
4269,good you know in case the exit isn’t clearly marked,Amy
4270,sheldon that’s enough,Amy
4271,i’ve never seen results like this before,Amy
4272,aren’t you glad you participated in this,Amy
4273,set up a second culture and try to replicate our results,Amy
4274,make a baby what are you talking about,Amy
4275,sheldon i’m not ready to have a baby,Amy
4276,wow i i can actually feel the egg crawling its way back up,Amy
4277,not right now,Amy
4278,i’m not playing anything we’re not making a baby today,Amy
4279,no he was explicit needlessly and freakishly explicit,Amy
4280,well there is a genetic component but that doesn’t guarantee anything,Amy
4281,hey you’re talking about the person i love and have been avoiding for the past three hours oh man,Amy
4282,hello,Amy
4283,i don’t think so,Amy
4284,sheldon please stop trying to seduce me,Amy
4285,i thought it smelled like a petting zoo in here,Amy
4286,okay i’ve had enough,Amy
4287,it was like being hit on by rat pack peewee herman,Amy
4288,no,Amy
4289,for god’s sake you’re ridiculous,Amy
4290,that was a close one,Amy
4291,did you say you guys are working on the guidance system tomorrow,Amy
4292,well sheldon said that he was gonna work with me on our quantum perception project,Amy
4293,well he reconfirmed with me this morning,Amy
4294,why did you tell leonard you’re working on the gyroscope tomorrow,Amy
4295,but you said you were working with me,Amy
4296,sheldon this is silly you can’t expect us to do quality work with you popping in and out like this,Amy
4297,incredible sheldon i didn’t expect that you could work on both projects but i i was wrong,Amy
4298,sheldon you’re sick go back to bed,Amy
4299,it’s okay now i don’t need butter,Amy
4300,you need sleep,Amy
4301,well i don’t want your germs around me,Amy
4302,sheldon are you okay,Amy

4316,well sheldon’s getting a little better with dogs he even took a picture with pluto at disneyland,Amy
4317,don’t listen to them what’s weird is that penny almost got a science fact right,Amy
4318,but you are aren’t you,Amy
4319,talk to me tell me what’s going on,Amy
4320,there are a lot of memories wrapped up in that room for me too the first time you told me you loved me was in that room,Amy

4357,why didn’t you tell me,Amy
4358,should i worry,Amy
4359,that’s what you said to me when i started dating him and then five years later bingo bango something happened,Amy
4360,you don’t get it i’ve been smacking that ketchup bottle for a long time all she’s got to do is tip it over and point it at her fries,Amy
4361,i don’t know might be the new jersey talking but this nowitzki broad needs to disappear,Amy

4369,it’s not important,Amy
4370,that’s great how so,Amy
4371,why don’t you ask me what i’m working on,Amy
4372,i’m doing some experiments to show that the signal to move a muscle occurs before you know you even decided to move it,Amy
4373,yes i’m trying to figure out to the nanometer and the attosecond precisely where and when an event of awareness takes place,Amy
4374,you know when i was six i wanted to marry the gorilla from good night gorilla maybe i was onto something,Amy
4375,you know i like harp lessons but i’m thinking of switching to elevator repair lessons what are you working on,Amy
4376,wait are you saying if we combine my experiment with your calculations we can determine the precise moment in time when the wave function collapses,Amy
4377,sheldon this is really interesting,Amy
4378,you know we’ve never collaborated professionally before are you worried it might affect our relationship,Amy
4379,well that would make me feel better,Amy
4380,that’s a ridiculous rule,Amy
4381,oh good what are they,Amy
4382,can i see that,Amy
4383,sheldon if we’re gonna have ground rules i’ll tell you the first ground rule i make the ground rules,Amy
4384,terrific do you want to hear our new set of ground rules,Amy
4385,number one we’re on the same team we’re not in competition,Amy
4386,number two disagreements can happen politely there’s no need to call an idea stupid,Amy
4387,are you listening,Amy
4388,number three to avoid getting frustrated we take builtin breaks and reward our successes with a small treat,Amy
4389,whatever you want so shall we get to work,Amy
4390,wow look at that,Amy
4391,so we’re agreed it’s complete garbage,Amy
4392,i don’t know where we went wrong,Amy
4393,well don’t give up maybe we can fix it,Amy
4394,i can hear your face talking so we’re even,Amy
4395,fine fine you want me to blow my nose here i’ll blow it better,Amy
4396,you know you’re exhausting i knew working together was a bad idea,Amy
4397,that would mean that this delayed parameter should be increased milliseconds,Amy
4398,i had a feeling you were using the wrong computational model but i didn’t say anything ’cause you’re so sensitive,Amy
4399,hey i wonder what kind of success we’d have if we defined measurement as the first moment that an action potential is seen by the visual cortex,Amy
4400,we’re finally making progress i wish we could do it without fighting,Amy
4401,i suppose it’s conceivable that the hormones associated with our fightorflight response could be sharpening our cognitive processes,Amy
4402,how dare you speak that way about my grammy and hey wait a second wait delta t could equal alpha subzero,Amy
4403,there’s only one clear choice,Amy
4404,no you bonehead,Amy
4405,revised ground rule number one we are on the same team but it is a competition,Amy
4406,revised ground rule number two there are definitely stupid questions and those who ask them can be told so right to their stupid face,Amy
4407,thanks babe number three fair topics for insult include educational pedigree scientific field intellectual prowess and mamas,Amy
4408,okay,Bernadette

4448,they did but the mommy and daddy didn’t like them so they shipped them off to an orphanage i made out of a shoebox,Bernadette
4449,not every girl dreams about being a mom sometimes you think you’re never gonna have kids and one day you wake up and you’re pregnant and it doesn’t matter that your career’s going great right now and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere taped to a dog,Bernadette
4450,sorry i flipped out on you i think it’s just hormones,Bernadette
